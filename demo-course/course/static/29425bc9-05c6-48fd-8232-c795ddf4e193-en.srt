00:00:14,560 --> 00:00:20,040
open source software which means that anyone  can use, modify or distribute the Open edX® code

00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:48,880
deliver learning experiences to their learners. The largest deployment of the Open edX® platform  

8
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:56,800
is edX.org. edX.org was founded in 2012 and it was  the original developer of the Open edX® software  

9
00:00:56,800 --> 00:01:03,520
which it released as open source in 2013. Today  edX.org operates with a select group of partners  

10
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:09,080
to create MOOCs and other high quality learning  experiences for their platform. Only edX partners  

11
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:14,160
can create courses on edX.org. So, regardless  of whether you&#39;re an individual running a  .

12
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:20,800
blended classroom experience for 30 users or an  edX.org partner offering a MOOC to 30,000 Learners  

13
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:28,834
you are both running on the same underlying  Open edX® software to deliver your learning experiences.
