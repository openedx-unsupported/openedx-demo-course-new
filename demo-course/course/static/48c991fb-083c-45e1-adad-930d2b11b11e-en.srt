many familiar faces people that have

21
00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:53,719
been working on this project

every year we&#39;re able to meet in person

26
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:04,379
so I&#39;m glad we&#39;re past the Cova times

27
00:01:02,699 --> 00:01:05,880
and we&#39;re here together again for the

28
00:01:04,379 --> 00:01:07,799
second year in a row

29
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:10,260
I wanted to briefly mention some

and I wanted to start by you know a

41
00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:43,740
really appreciated Cheryl&#39;s presentation

42
00:01:39,860 --> 00:01:46,619
but wanted to start by thanking MIT open

43
00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:48,119
learning their generous support in

44
00:01:46,619 --> 00:01:50,280
sponsoring us and letting us use the

45
00:01:48,119 --> 00:01:51,259
space at MIT has made this conference

46
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:53,340
possible

47
00:01:51,259 --> 00:01:55,619
you know as she said we&#39;re in one of the

48
00:01:53,340 --> 00:01:58,500
most iconic classrooms in all of MIT

49
00:01:55,619 --> 00:02:01,259
which doesn&#39;t Inspire the least bit of

50
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:03,180
imposter syndrome at all

51
00:02:01,259 --> 00:02:05,939
um but let&#39;s give another round of a

52
00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:08,299
round of applause to the MIT folks for

53
00:02:05,939 --> 00:02:08,299
hosting us

54
00:02:08,538 --> 00:02:15,459
[Applause]

55
00:02:15,540 --> 00:02:21,000
um and I&#39;m especially grateful to be at

56
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:22,620
MIT this year and to be hosting part of

57
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:25,379
our conference in the stata center

58
00:02:22,620 --> 00:02:27,720
because it is literally where the open

59
00:02:25,379 --> 00:02:30,060
edx project began I mentioned this in

60
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:33,000
the welcome letter in the program but

61
00:02:30,060 --> 00:02:34,680
the first lines of code that uh that

62
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:38,099
were written that are now the platform

63
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:40,319
that we all work on and use today were

64
00:02:38,099 --> 00:02:43,860
written in a small room in the third

65
00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:45,959
floor of status Center in 2011. uh

66
00:02:43,860 --> 00:02:47,879
clarify that I was not involved in 2011

67
00:02:45,959 --> 00:02:49,560
I came later in the project but we

68
00:02:47,879 --> 00:02:52,680
actually have an engineer who works on

69
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:54,480
tcrill today who was amongst those first

70
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:56,700
three Engineers cramped into the third

71
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:58,800
floor of stata Center uh writing the

72
00:02:56,700 --> 00:03:01,019
platform and so it feels really

73
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:04,260
important to be back at MIT in stata

74
00:03:01,019 --> 00:03:06,480
this year as we are launching or

75
00:03:04,260 --> 00:03:09,420
continuing our journey as an open source

76
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:12,300
project and trying to become the

77
00:03:09,420 --> 00:03:14,840
inclusive duocacy that we aspire to be

78
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:14,840
as a project

79
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:21,239
and I want to thank our sponsors as well

80
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:25,879
our first sponsor our Cornerstone

81
00:03:21,239 --> 00:03:25,879
sponsor is a university technology

82
00:03:27,319 --> 00:03:33,360
UTech is an organization from Uruguay

83
00:03:30,420 --> 00:03:35,459
that concentrates on providing

84
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:38,519
educational opportunities to college

85
00:03:35,459 --> 00:03:40,860
students outside of the urban areas they

86
00:03:38,519 --> 00:03:44,340
serve students in all 19 provinces of

87
00:03:40,860 --> 00:03:46,860
Uruguay and and the majority of their

88
00:03:44,340 --> 00:03:49,019
students are the first the first student

89
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:50,159
to attend University and their family so

90
00:03:49,019 --> 00:03:53,340
it&#39;s a really really great Mission

91
00:03:50,159 --> 00:03:55,140
they&#39;ve been using openedx since 2014.

92
00:03:53,340 --> 00:03:58,340
we&#39;re glad to have them here and we

93
00:03:55,140 --> 00:03:58,340
really appreciate their sponsorship

94
00:04:02,780 --> 00:04:08,099
and our Premier sponsor is edley also

95
00:04:06,659 --> 00:04:10,200
long-standing members of the community

96
00:04:08,099 --> 00:04:14,220
they&#39;ve been contributors to the open

97
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:16,680
edx project since 2013. they provide a

98
00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:20,100
wide range of services related to the to

99
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:22,199
the platform Ed Lee UTech and the rest

100
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:24,360
of our sponsors have tables in the

101
00:04:22,199 --> 00:04:26,460
sponsor Hall I encourage you to stop by

102
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:30,860
and speak with them and understand what

103
00:04:26,460 --> 00:04:30,860
they&#39;re doing so thanks to edley as well

104
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:38,160
so let&#39;s get into the meat of the

105
00:04:36,060 --> 00:04:40,680
presentation and review the state of

106
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:43,520
open edx and this presentation is going

107
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:46,259
to be broken down into three segments

108
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:47,240
I&#39;m going to talk about the present of

109
00:04:46,259 --> 00:04:49,560
the project

110
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:51,600
Jenna Makowski is going to come up and

111
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:53,699
talk about product management for the

112
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:56,280
open source project and kind of the

113
00:04:53,699 --> 00:04:58,020
future Direction and priorities and then

114
00:04:56,280 --> 00:05:01,440
finally we&#39;re going to be joined by

115
00:04:58,020 --> 00:05:03,000
Adrian devison of Empower Empower is a

116
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:04,620
user of open edx and member of the

117
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,660
community it&#39;s doing some really amazing

118
00:05:04,620 --> 00:05:08,639
work and we&#39;ll learn more about the

119
00:05:06,660 --> 00:05:12,380
Empower organization and the project

120
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:12,380
that that they are working on

121
00:05:12,900 --> 00:05:17,580
um so let&#39;s start with the present I&#39;m

122
00:05:15,060 --> 00:05:19,440
going to talk about uh three

123
00:05:17,580 --> 00:05:21,660
three main things here

124
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:23,940
um I want to review the open edx vision

125
00:05:21,660 --> 00:05:25,440
statement that was developed by the

126
00:05:23,940 --> 00:05:27,120
product working group in the fall and

127
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:30,840
reviewed by the technical oversight

128
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:33,360
Committee of the project in December

129
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:35,880
I want to review the reach of the

130
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:38,759
platform we&#39;ll talk a little bit about

131
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:40,680
some metrics about how many instances of

132
00:05:38,759 --> 00:05:42,660
the platform exist how many users have

133
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:46,259
been learning on it how many degrees

134
00:05:42,660 --> 00:05:48,479
have been issued

135
00:05:46,259 --> 00:05:50,520
and finally we&#39;ll look at Community

136
00:05:48,479 --> 00:05:52,500
Health some key metrics that help us

137
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:55,740
understand how healthy we are as a

138
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:58,500
community because our community is the

139
00:05:55,740 --> 00:06:02,400
the engine that advances the open edx

140
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:04,620
platform really okay that advances the

141
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:06,780
open edx platform so we need to keep a

142
00:06:04,620 --> 00:06:09,539
close eye on our help

143
00:06:06,780 --> 00:06:11,280
and also I can I can see from the timing

144
00:06:09,539 --> 00:06:13,199
cards that reviewing the recently

145
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:15,180
shipped features is probably going to

146
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:18,360
get skipped over but Jenna is going to

147
00:06:15,180 --> 00:06:20,520
give us a tour of how you can track that

148
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:22,319
continuously in real time when she gets

149
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:26,120
into this segment about the product the

150
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:26,120
how-to for the product roadmap

151
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:31,500
all right so let&#39;s start with the vision

152
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:33,479
statement this was developed by a

153
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:36,900
segment of the product working group who

154
00:06:33,479 --> 00:06:40,919
conducted interviews surveys and worked

155
00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:43,919
with the community to try to compose a

156
00:06:40,919 --> 00:06:46,979
mission based on everything that we

157
00:06:43,919 --> 00:06:48,780
valued and and I&#39;ll present that today

158
00:06:46,979 --> 00:06:50,039
this has been presented in other forums

159
00:06:48,780 --> 00:06:52,440
you may have seen it but if you haven&#39;t

160
00:06:50,039 --> 00:06:54,360
we&#39;ll talk it through today

161
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:55,979
um so the vision statement as they

162
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:59,100
defined it was that we&#39;re leveraging

163
00:06:55,979 --> 00:07:01,800
open source to democratize education and

164
00:06:59,100 --> 00:07:03,300
power advances in learning

165
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:05,100
and let&#39;s

166
00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:07,580
let&#39;s kind of break that down a little

167
00:07:05,100 --> 00:07:07,580
bit all right

168
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:13,080
all right the first part of it is about

169
00:07:11,220 --> 00:07:14,580
how we do it and I don&#39;t think this is

170
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:16,220
controversial we&#39;re an open source

171
00:07:14,580 --> 00:07:20,039
project we&#39;re an open source Community

172
00:07:16,220 --> 00:07:23,759
we believe that communities that have

173
00:07:20,039 --> 00:07:24,900
shared values and have a shared uh kind

174
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:27,240
of

175
00:07:24,900 --> 00:07:28,680
requirements for the platform when they

176
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:31,740
collaborate in the open and create open

177
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:33,900
source software create powerful Dynamics

178
00:07:31,740 --> 00:07:35,580
and

179
00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:37,319
so leveraging open source is pretty

180
00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:39,720
obvious to us

181
00:07:37,319 --> 00:07:41,340
the next two parts of it are really what

182
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:43,580
we aspire to do

183
00:07:41,340 --> 00:07:45,960
the first is to democratize education

184
00:07:43,580 --> 00:07:48,900
and we&#39;ll dig into this a little bit

185
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:50,580
more in the next slides because we want

186
00:07:48,900 --> 00:07:52,259
this to be more than just pretty words

187
00:07:50,580 --> 00:07:54,479
we want this to be something that helps

188
00:07:52,259 --> 00:07:56,099
us frame our priorities and Inspire us

189
00:07:54,479 --> 00:07:58,800
as we move forward

190
00:07:56,099 --> 00:08:01,620
and the second part of the what is power

191
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:04,080
advances in learning and this has been a

192
00:08:01,620 --> 00:08:06,060
part of the mission of edx and open edx

193
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:08,819
since very early it was framed

194
00:08:06,060 --> 00:08:11,039
originally as improved in educa

195
00:08:08,819 --> 00:08:12,900
improving education online and on campus

196
00:08:11,039 --> 00:08:14,400
and it continues to be an important part

197
00:08:12,900 --> 00:08:16,919
of our mission but maybe a place where

198
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:18,360
we stand to improve a little bit

199
00:08:16,919 --> 00:08:21,199
all right so let&#39;s start with

200
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:24,180
democratizing education

201
00:08:21,199 --> 00:08:26,639
for me democratizing education boils

202
00:08:24,180 --> 00:08:29,039
down into two key things that we want to

203
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:30,780
achieve one is improving access to

204
00:08:29,039 --> 00:08:33,320
educational opportunities of high

205
00:08:30,780 --> 00:08:35,700
quality for students all over the world

206
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:38,459
and remove impediments to those

207
00:08:35,700 --> 00:08:41,700
opportunities whenever we can technology

208
00:08:38,458 --> 00:08:44,339
is you know an enabling tool to help us

209
00:08:41,700 --> 00:08:48,300
do that but it is not necessary and

210
00:08:44,339 --> 00:08:51,060
sufficient it requires uh you know that

211
00:08:48,300 --> 00:08:53,160
it requires also the organizations that

212
00:08:51,060 --> 00:08:55,680
produce the content to make it available

213
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:58,140
to students and a commitment to to

214
00:08:55,680 --> 00:09:00,120
knocking down barriers to access

215
00:08:58,140 --> 00:09:01,860
and the second part of it is kind of

216
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:02,519
impact so

217
00:09:01,860 --> 00:09:04,920
um

218
00:09:02,519 --> 00:09:07,380
the platform itself as software can&#39;t

219
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:08,820
guarantee impact in the lives of our

220
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:11,640
learners but ultimately that&#39;s what

221
00:09:08,820 --> 00:09:14,880
we&#39;re aspiring to do so we need to have

222
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:17,519
a platform that can deliver the highest

223
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:19,560
quality educational opportunities and we

224
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:20,519
need a way to measure the efficacy of

225
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:22,980
the different

226
00:09:20,519 --> 00:09:26,700
things that the platform does and to

227
00:09:22,980 --> 00:09:29,480
prioritize adding advancing the platform

228
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:29,480
in that respect

229
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:33,540
all right and then let&#39;s talk a little

230
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:35,040
bit about what driving advances in

231
00:09:33,540 --> 00:09:36,959
learning could look like I think this is

232
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:38,580
again the vision statement is

233
00:09:36,959 --> 00:09:39,779
aspirational we don&#39;t claim that these

234
00:09:38,580 --> 00:09:42,120
are things that we&#39;ve already achieved

235
00:09:39,779 --> 00:09:43,920
these are things that we want to achieve

236
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:45,899
as a community

237
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:47,459
all right so we obviously have the open

238
00:09:45,899 --> 00:09:50,399
edx platform we&#39;re all familiar with

239
00:09:47,459 --> 00:09:52,560
that the platform has some some key

240
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:55,260
features in it today that really enable

241
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:57,959
experimentation and Innovation extension

242
00:09:55,260 --> 00:10:01,500
points like Xbox things like a b testing

243
00:09:57,959 --> 00:10:04,560
cohorts that are really powerful ways of

244
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:07,260
of conducting tests within online

245
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:09,899
courses and as students interact with

246
00:10:07,260 --> 00:10:12,420
those with that content

247
00:10:09,899 --> 00:10:13,740
we produce data and learning traces

248
00:10:12,420 --> 00:10:16,800
everyone&#39;s familiar with the tracking

249
00:10:13,740 --> 00:10:19,140
logs we also have X API versions of data

250
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:22,320
traces that data can then become the

251
00:10:19,140 --> 00:10:23,459
input into research and advances in

252
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:25,320
learning

253
00:10:23,459 --> 00:10:27,120
um and there have been a lot of

254
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:28,860
interesting papers I mean and I can

255
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:30,959
probably quote the number of papers that

256
00:10:28,860 --> 00:10:32,640
have been produced from from edx data

257
00:10:30,959 --> 00:10:34,200
but a lot of interesting research has

258
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:36,660
been produced from the data that we

259
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:39,060
generate on the edx platform and also in

260
00:10:36,660 --> 00:10:41,399
other instances of the platform but for

261
00:10:39,060 --> 00:10:44,820
me the key thing that we haven&#39;t done

262
00:10:41,399 --> 00:10:45,980
well enough is this last arrow is how do

263
00:10:44,820 --> 00:10:49,680
we then

264
00:10:45,980 --> 00:10:52,140
turn that research into advances in

265
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:54,240
learning into a complete feedback loop

266
00:10:52,140 --> 00:10:55,800
that helps us prioritize and Advance the

267
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:58,320
platform in a way that makes it more

268
00:10:55,800 --> 00:11:00,120
efficacious for our users so that I

269
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:01,880
think is a challenge that lies before us

270
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:06,019
and one that I&#39;ll present to you

271
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:06,019
so let&#39;s figure out how to do that

272
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:11,779
and then in summary uh

273
00:11:11,899 --> 00:11:17,040
this Friday we have the town hall

274
00:11:14,459 --> 00:11:18,600
meeting and this is the proposed vision

275
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:20,279
statement from the product working group

276
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:23,519
I think the town hall would be a great

277
00:11:20,279 --> 00:11:25,880
time to come and add your voice to this

278
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:28,800
conversation to ask any questions

279
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:30,300
clarifying questions or to take us to

280
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:31,740
task if you think we&#39;ve gotten something

281
00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:33,660
wrong here so please attend the town

282
00:11:31,740 --> 00:11:35,820
hall on Friday let&#39;s have a robust

283
00:11:33,660 --> 00:11:37,560
discussion about the vision for the

284
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:39,000
platform

285
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:40,620
all right

286
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:42,540
I want to talk a little bit about reach

287
00:11:40,620 --> 00:11:44,579
we have some statistics about the usage

288
00:11:42,540 --> 00:11:47,040
of the platform this is a place we&#39;ve

289
00:11:44,579 --> 00:11:49,860
invested in the last couple years

290
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:51,660
because our ability to determine who was

291
00:11:49,860 --> 00:11:54,000
using our open source project was

292
00:11:51,660 --> 00:11:55,860
somewhat limited it&#39;s important to know

293
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:57,899
the reach of the project because it

294
00:11:55,860 --> 00:11:59,640
indicates a couple of things one is are

295
00:11:57,899 --> 00:12:03,300
we building something that people care

296
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:06,720
about that people want and also the

297
00:12:03,300 --> 00:12:09,180
reach of the platform determines the

298
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:11,700
size of the network of our community the

299
00:12:09,180 --> 00:12:12,959
size of the network determines who is

300
00:12:11,700 --> 00:12:14,459
contributing and how many people are

301
00:12:12,959 --> 00:12:15,959
contributing and how much value we&#39;re

302
00:12:14,459 --> 00:12:17,579
creating so it&#39;s important for those

303
00:12:15,959 --> 00:12:18,480
reasons

304
00:12:17,579 --> 00:12:21,060
um

305
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:23,339
so we have a new technology we&#39;ve

306
00:12:21,060 --> 00:12:25,380
brought online to help us determine how

307
00:12:23,339 --> 00:12:28,320
many instances we have we know that

308
00:12:25,380 --> 00:12:30,420
today there are more than 4 500 live

309
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:32,300
instances of the open edx platform on

310
00:12:30,420 --> 00:12:35,220
the public internet

311
00:12:32,300 --> 00:12:38,459
across those instances we know that

312
00:12:35,220 --> 00:12:41,579
there are more than 70 000 courses that

313
00:12:38,459 --> 00:12:43,560
are being offered on open edx today

314
00:12:41,579 --> 00:12:46,079
and we know that across the instances

315
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:48,720
this number is is the hardest to gather

316
00:12:46,079 --> 00:12:50,279
because we rely on people telling us how

317
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:52,260
many registered users they have we don&#39;t

318
00:12:50,279 --> 00:12:54,300
have any way of harvesting that data but

319
00:12:52,260 --> 00:12:55,800
we know we have at least 77 million

320
00:12:54,300 --> 00:12:58,579
users who have interacted with the open

321
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:58,579
edx platform

322
00:13:01,019 --> 00:13:04,440
okay

323
00:13:02,339 --> 00:13:05,760
and

324
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:07,860
I don&#39;t think I&#39;m going to fool anybody

325
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:09,240
as I draw my second flywheel of the

326
00:13:07,860 --> 00:13:10,740
presentation the first one being a

327
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:13,440
square and the second one being erect

328
00:13:10,740 --> 00:13:15,420
being a triangle but I&#39;m going to do it

329
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:17,339
anyway right so

330
00:13:15,420 --> 00:13:19,380
um just sort of to reinforce why reach

331
00:13:17,339 --> 00:13:22,019
is so important in open source projects

332
00:13:19,380 --> 00:13:23,040
is because the the greater the reach we

333
00:13:22,019 --> 00:13:24,959
have

334
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:26,940
some segment of the community that

335
00:13:24,959 --> 00:13:29,220
you&#39;re touching or contributing back and

336
00:13:26,940 --> 00:13:31,260
innovating on the platform you can

337
00:13:29,220 --> 00:13:33,660
increase the size of that segment but

338
00:13:31,260 --> 00:13:35,399
the more the bigger the overall Network

339
00:13:33,660 --> 00:13:38,100
the more people you have contributing

340
00:13:35,399 --> 00:13:40,980
and investing that investment generates

341
00:13:38,100 --> 00:13:43,680
additional value for the platform which

342
00:13:40,980 --> 00:13:46,019
in turn makes it more attractive to new

343
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:48,360
users and increases the reach and if we

344
00:13:46,019 --> 00:13:51,300
can continue going around this this

345
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:53,700
virtuous circle then we over time build

346
00:13:51,300 --> 00:13:55,200
the most efficacious platform and can

347
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:58,279
have the greatest impact in the lives of

348
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:58,279
our Learners across the world

349
00:13:58,620 --> 00:14:03,899
oops okay

350
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:06,480
um but the engine behind all of this is

351
00:14:03,899 --> 00:14:09,060
you the community that that develops

352
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:10,740
openedx and uses openedx so let&#39;s take a

353
00:14:09,060 --> 00:14:12,779
quick look at the health of the

354
00:14:10,740 --> 00:14:14,760
community based on two things on some

355
00:14:12,779 --> 00:14:18,060
statistics we can measure and some

356
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:20,100
stories that I will I&#39;ll try to tell

357
00:14:18,060 --> 00:14:22,260
um okay the so contribution to community

358
00:14:20,100 --> 00:14:23,940
metrics we&#39;ll start with a salute to

359
00:14:22,260 --> 00:14:25,380
working groups which I think are one of

360
00:14:23,940 --> 00:14:26,339
the most important parts of our project

361
00:14:25,380 --> 00:14:28,980
today

362
00:14:26,339 --> 00:14:30,240
uh and then something briefly about a

363
00:14:28,980 --> 00:14:32,639
program that we&#39;re doing around

364
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:34,200
maintainership

365
00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:36,000
okay

366
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:38,100
right today we know we have about 24

367
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:41,100
different organizations that are

368
00:14:38,100 --> 00:14:42,600
contributing to the project just just be

369
00:14:41,100 --> 00:14:44,220
full transparency that&#39;s pretty flat

370
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:45,959
that hasn&#39;t changed a lot over the last

371
00:14:44,220 --> 00:14:48,420
couple years

372
00:14:45,959 --> 00:14:52,320
um we have 333 people in the last year

373
00:14:48,420 --> 00:14:55,380
who contributed code to the platform

374
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:57,480
and we have 10 active working groups so

375
00:14:55,380 --> 00:14:59,880
this is interesting because last year at

376
00:14:57,480 --> 00:15:02,100
Lisbon we had around five working groups

377
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:03,720
that were active so it&#39;s increased two

378
00:15:02,100 --> 00:15:05,279
times in that time and I think for a

379
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:08,040
very good reason because it&#39;s probably

380
00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:09,660
the best way to participate in the

381
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:11,880
project and it the working groups drive

382
00:15:09,660 --> 00:15:13,320
so much value to us and we&#39;ll talk we&#39;ll

383
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:14,279
have a specific slide to talk about them

384
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:16,560
later

385
00:15:14,279 --> 00:15:18,720
we have 50 core contributors core

386
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:20,399
contributors are the folks who are most

387
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:22,579
you know who have made a personal

388
00:15:20,399 --> 00:15:25,019
commitment to dedicate their time

389
00:15:22,579 --> 00:15:26,820
continuously to the project they have

390
00:15:25,019 --> 00:15:30,540
additional responsibilities that come

391
00:15:26,820 --> 00:15:32,399
along with that but this group of folks

392
00:15:30,540 --> 00:15:34,740
are the they&#39;re the most dedicated

393
00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:37,260
contributors across the entire project

394
00:15:34,740 --> 00:15:39,300
last year this was 41 we&#39;ve grown it by

395
00:15:37,260 --> 00:15:41,880
50 by the end of this by the end of next

396
00:15:39,300 --> 00:15:42,959
week I expect this to be 53 and this is

397
00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:45,680
a place where we&#39;re going to continue to

398
00:15:42,959 --> 00:15:48,060
invest in growing that cohort

399
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:50,040
we have 13 officially supported

400
00:15:48,060 --> 00:15:51,720
languages on the platform officially

401
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:53,959
supported languages are languages that

402
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:57,540
are translated to a rate of 100 percent

403
00:15:53,959 --> 00:16:00,480
for our open edx releases this is up

404
00:15:57,540 --> 00:16:02,579
from 10 last year so also a significant

405
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:05,480
uh Improvement in the languages that we

406
00:16:02,579 --> 00:16:05,480
support on the platform

407
00:16:05,660 --> 00:16:10,860
and it all adds up to what we see here

408
00:16:08,699 --> 00:16:13,740
this is a graph of contributions over

409
00:16:10,860 --> 00:16:16,740
the last two years measured as lines of

410
00:16:13,740 --> 00:16:19,500
code added to the platform the red line

411
00:16:16,740 --> 00:16:21,779
is the trend line you can see that we&#39;ve

412
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:22,980
seen a steady increase it&#39;s lumpy but

413
00:16:21,779 --> 00:16:25,260
we&#39;re seeing a steady increase in

414
00:16:22,980 --> 00:16:27,180
contribution over time lines of code

415
00:16:25,260 --> 00:16:29,160
added is not the perfect metric there

416
00:16:27,180 --> 00:16:31,199
isn&#39;t one but I think it&#39;s a good enough

417
00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:34,620
metric for us if we look at this

418
00:16:31,199 --> 00:16:36,540
cumulatively it represents a 54 increase

419
00:16:34,620 --> 00:16:40,459
year over year over the last two years

420
00:16:36,540 --> 00:16:40,459
in line subcode added to the platform

421
00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:45,180
oop just jumped ahead but so quickly I

422
00:16:43,860 --> 00:16:46,680
wanted to talk about some sources of

423
00:16:45,180 --> 00:16:48,180
growth

424
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:49,860
um one of the big sources of growth has

425
00:16:48,180 --> 00:16:51,540
been the innovation of micro front ends

426
00:16:49,860 --> 00:16:54,540
that&#39;s a technology that&#39;s really taken

427
00:16:51,540 --> 00:16:56,160
off we now have I think 28 micro front

428
00:16:54,540 --> 00:16:57,839
ends there&#39;s a lot of development energy

429
00:16:56,160 --> 00:17:00,360
around them and that&#39;s driven a lot of

430
00:16:57,839 --> 00:17:02,880
increasing in contribution

431
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:05,040
of T Krill has been funding

432
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:07,319
contributions where for critical areas

433
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:08,640
in the platform where we see gaps that

434
00:17:07,319 --> 00:17:10,860
will you know fill in those gaps will

435
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:12,419
benefit everyone across the community so

436
00:17:10,859 --> 00:17:14,220
that&#39;s another source of growth of

437
00:17:12,419 --> 00:17:16,199
contribution and finally the growth in

438
00:17:14,220 --> 00:17:17,339
core contributors has been in other area

439
00:17:16,199 --> 00:17:18,959
where

440
00:17:17,339 --> 00:17:20,339
um you know the growth in the people

441
00:17:18,959 --> 00:17:22,020
participating in that program and

442
00:17:20,339 --> 00:17:24,720
dedicating a significant amount of their

443
00:17:22,020 --> 00:17:27,299
time to the to the platform has has been

444
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:28,980
important there as well

445
00:17:27,299 --> 00:17:31,919
and I want to spend some time talking

446
00:17:28,980 --> 00:17:33,480
about the metaphor we often use about

447
00:17:31,919 --> 00:17:35,880
open edx is it feels like we&#39;re building

448
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:37,740
the plane while we&#39;re flying it

449
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:40,799
um in this case we&#39;re just building

450
00:17:37,740 --> 00:17:43,440
something very complex as a group so as

451
00:17:40,799 --> 00:17:44,400
I mentioned we&#39;ve got 10 working groups

452
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:46,679
um

453
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:48,600
those are the folks that coordinate the

454
00:17:46,679 --> 00:17:49,679
work they plan the work they determine

455
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:52,200
what the priorities are and they

456
00:17:49,679 --> 00:17:54,539
actually do the work working groups

457
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:58,140
focus on anything from translation and

458
00:17:54,539 --> 00:18:00,240
marketing to devops to deprecation to

459
00:17:58,140 --> 00:18:01,740
releasing the platform basically all of

460
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:03,240
the critical activities of the project

461
00:18:01,740 --> 00:18:06,840
happen in working groups so if you&#39;re

462
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:08,820
interested in in becoming uh

463
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:10,860
participating more directly in the

464
00:18:08,820 --> 00:18:13,380
project working groups are the place to

465
00:18:10,860 --> 00:18:14,820
go and this Friday the working groups

466
00:18:13,380 --> 00:18:17,520
will be having sessions where you can

467
00:18:14,820 --> 00:18:19,020
drop in and meet the members and see

468
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:20,220
what they&#39;re working on and so if there

469
00:18:19,020 --> 00:18:23,220
are working groups that are particularly

470
00:18:20,220 --> 00:18:25,140
interesting to you please join on Friday

471
00:18:23,220 --> 00:18:27,360
and also

472
00:18:25,140 --> 00:18:28,679
I don&#39;t have time to summarize all of

473
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:30,960
the great things the working groups have

474
00:18:28,679 --> 00:18:35,520
done however they have all produced

475
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:37,559
reports of their priorities and and

476
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:40,140
accomplishments for the last six months

477
00:18:37,559 --> 00:18:41,760
and they&#39;re in the wiki and I&#39;ll share a

478
00:18:40,140 --> 00:18:42,960
link into the events Channel later so if

479
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:44,280
you want to follow up on with the

480
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:46,880
specific working group so do you please

481
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:46,880
check in there

482
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:53,160
and finally I wanted to say when I ask

483
00:18:51,780 --> 00:18:55,080
the community what we should talk about

484
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:57,299
in the state of open edx several people

485
00:18:55,080 --> 00:18:58,860
said let&#39;s talk about maintainership but

486
00:18:57,299 --> 00:19:00,720
we don&#39;t have time to talk about it in

487
00:18:58,860 --> 00:19:03,419
depth today but I wanted to mention that

488
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:06,780
we&#39;re having an online meetup on April

489
00:19:03,419 --> 00:19:08,700
27th and I&#39;m going to do a deep dive

490
00:19:06,780 --> 00:19:10,320
into maintainership and the state of

491
00:19:08,700 --> 00:19:12,720
maintainership for openedx so if that&#39;s

492
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:15,559
an interesting topic for you please join

493
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:15,559
us then all right

494
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:22,559
okay and then quickly I&#39;ll talk about

495
00:19:19,620 --> 00:19:24,539
some features that have shipped recently

496
00:19:22,559 --> 00:19:27,059
um and then Jenna and this this is the

497
00:19:24,539 --> 00:19:28,380
the present version of things

498
00:19:27,059 --> 00:19:31,020
um

499
00:19:28,380 --> 00:19:32,340
and these are focused on the personas uh

500
00:19:31,020 --> 00:19:35,340
that we&#39;re tracking in the product

501
00:19:32,340 --> 00:19:36,840
working group so a lot of these features

502
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:38,820
you know give credit where credit were

503
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:41,960
due we&#39;re developed by engineers at 2u

504
00:19:38,820 --> 00:19:45,539
or at in to you via Blended projects so

505
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:48,600
the new problem editor ux new text

506
00:19:45,539 --> 00:19:50,700
editor ux have been launched those were

507
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:53,520
contributed by 2u so thank you to you

508
00:19:50,700 --> 00:19:55,620
for that I think Advanced or a staff

509
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:56,220
grader also was

510
00:19:55,620 --> 00:19:59,039
um

511
00:19:56,220 --> 00:20:01,500
on the platform on the learner&#39;s side I

512
00:19:59,039 --> 00:20:03,900
think everyone is aware of the large new

513
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:05,880
discussions rollout we now have several

514
00:20:03,900 --> 00:20:08,760
different discussion forums that are

515
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:10,440
available on the platform discussions

516
00:20:08,760 --> 00:20:12,000
have been a long-standing point of pain

517
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:13,919
for members of the community so I think

518
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:17,400
everyone&#39;s happy to see options and also

519
00:20:13,919 --> 00:20:19,140
a very much improved native discussions

520
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:20,700
offering

521
00:20:19,140 --> 00:20:22,500
and um

522
00:20:20,700 --> 00:20:25,020
team-based auras there was a session on

523
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:26,280
that yesterday those are great so if you

524
00:20:25,020 --> 00:20:28,260
have you know

525
00:20:26,280 --> 00:20:29,520
Udo I think his session was recorded as

526
00:20:28,260 --> 00:20:32,580
Zoom so if you want to know more about

527
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:35,520
team-based auras please watch that and

528
00:20:32,580 --> 00:20:37,500
then some platform focused stuff

529
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:39,480
um some big ones like runtime

530
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:42,480
configuration for micro front ends was

531
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:44,340
something that came out in Olive it was

532
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:46,980
a big win for

533
00:20:44,340 --> 00:20:49,260
um for micro front end development lots

534
00:20:46,980 --> 00:20:52,460
of investment in tutor improvements and

535
00:20:49,260 --> 00:20:52,460
platform documentation

536
00:20:52,760 --> 00:20:58,799
now I want to hand over to Jenna who is

537
00:20:56,100 --> 00:21:00,660
the leading product at tcrill she&#39;s

538
00:20:58,799 --> 00:21:03,000
going to speak about sort of our product

539
00:21:00,660 --> 00:21:07,180
management processes and the platform

540
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:13,220
priorities and hand the clicker to you

541
00:21:07,180 --> 00:21:16,559
[Applause]

542
00:21:13,220 --> 00:21:18,539
thank you Ed can everyone hear me okay

543
00:21:16,559 --> 00:21:20,700
awesome

544
00:21:18,539 --> 00:21:23,520
so like Ed mentioned this portion of the

545
00:21:20,700 --> 00:21:25,140
talk is focused on looking forward to

546
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:27,299
product plans and some of our priorities

547
00:21:25,140 --> 00:21:28,919
and where we&#39;re investing but I wanted

548
00:21:27,299 --> 00:21:31,020
to take a couple of minutes here at the

549
00:21:28,919 --> 00:21:32,700
beginning to look back because I think

550
00:21:31,020 --> 00:21:36,140
by looking back that will help us to

551
00:21:32,700 --> 00:21:36,140
think about how we move forward

552
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:41,520
some of you may remember the slide from

553
00:21:38,700 --> 00:21:43,799
last year I presented this slide at the

554
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:45,419
state of open edx talk in Lisbon

555
00:21:43,799 --> 00:21:48,000
and if you don&#39;t remember or if you

556
00:21:45,419 --> 00:21:49,980
weren&#39;t here this is the main topic that

557
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:52,860
we addressed last year in the state was

558
00:21:49,980 --> 00:21:55,140
how do how we would spend the next year

559
00:21:52,860 --> 00:21:57,299
building a product organization within

560
00:21:55,140 --> 00:21:59,880
the openatix community

561
00:21:57,299 --> 00:22:01,860
and this Double Diamond was the

562
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:03,960
framework that I proposed we used to

563
00:22:01,860 --> 00:22:05,940
build that product organization

564
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:07,980
so as a quick recap the Double Diamond

565
00:22:05,940 --> 00:22:10,320
framework is a pretty popular method or

566
00:22:07,980 --> 00:22:12,480
methodology of product delivery

567
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:15,419
and on the

568
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:17,460
left side of the process so it&#39;s like a

569
00:22:15,419 --> 00:22:20,039
it&#39;s a workflow the left side is more

570
00:22:17,460 --> 00:22:22,860
product oriented so focusing on

571
00:22:20,039 --> 00:22:25,020
Discovery around new features focusing

572
00:22:22,860 --> 00:22:26,940
on definition of features this is where

573
00:22:25,020 --> 00:22:28,260
you find all of your user stories all of

574
00:22:26,940 --> 00:22:30,000
your market research all your Market

575
00:22:28,260 --> 00:22:31,559
data everything that you use to drive

576
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:33,600
what you what you build on the platform

577
00:22:31,559 --> 00:22:36,240
and why

578
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:37,500
and the second half of the Double

579
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:39,720
Diamond framework is the technical

580
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:40,740
execution side right development and

581
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:43,860
delivery

582
00:22:40,740 --> 00:22:45,600
and what I observed last last year at

583
00:22:43,860 --> 00:22:48,360
the talk was that a lot of the energy

584
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:50,520
and momentum around the project tends to

585
00:22:48,360 --> 00:22:52,860
be more focused on this side on the

586
00:22:50,520 --> 00:22:55,020
implementation side with less of a focus

587
00:22:52,860 --> 00:22:56,039
at least in the open community on the

588
00:22:55,020 --> 00:22:58,440
product side

589
00:22:56,039 --> 00:23:00,840
and so

590
00:22:58,440 --> 00:23:02,340
I&#39;d propose that we focus on reshifting

591
00:23:00,840 --> 00:23:04,380
spending the year to reshift that

592
00:23:02,340 --> 00:23:06,419
balance a little bit

593
00:23:04,380 --> 00:23:07,799
um that was last year and I&#39;m really

594
00:23:06,419 --> 00:23:10,380
happy to say that we&#39;ve made a ton of

595
00:23:07,799 --> 00:23:12,000
progress in the past year I&#39;m very proud

596
00:23:10,380 --> 00:23:13,559
of how product managers across the

597
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,760
community have really come together and

598
00:23:13,559 --> 00:23:17,880
helped us to build a product

599
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:21,260
Organization for the open edx Community

600
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:21,260
as a whole so thank you to everybody

601
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:26,640
um today I&#39;d like to highlight three of

602
00:23:24,179 --> 00:23:28,559
the key processes and artifacts that we

603
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:31,260
as an open source Community with the

604
00:23:28,559 --> 00:23:32,460
product organization have built over the

605
00:23:31,260 --> 00:23:34,080
past year

606
00:23:32,460 --> 00:23:35,760
so that we could really bring this

607
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:38,159
framework to life

608
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:39,780
those three things are the product

609
00:23:38,159 --> 00:23:42,299
working group

610
00:23:39,780 --> 00:23:45,080
feature development in the open

611
00:23:42,299 --> 00:23:45,080
and the roadmap

612
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:50,940
so let&#39;s start by answering a couple of

613
00:23:48,780 --> 00:23:53,960
basic questions who is openedx product

614
00:23:50,940 --> 00:23:53,960
and what do we do

615
00:23:54,360 --> 00:23:58,559
this is openedx product

616
00:23:56,039 --> 00:24:00,120
a lot of these are the product leaders

617
00:23:58,559 --> 00:24:03,539
from organizations across the community

618
00:24:00,120 --> 00:24:05,159
many of you are here today

619
00:24:03,539 --> 00:24:06,659
um and this is this is the product

620
00:24:05,159 --> 00:24:09,120
working group this is the engine that

621
00:24:06,659 --> 00:24:10,740
drives the open edx project we&#39;ve had

622
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:12,419
folks representing nearly a dozen

623
00:24:10,740 --> 00:24:15,480
organizations in the group over the past

624
00:24:12,419 --> 00:24:19,520
year including 2u Tik role Ed Lee edu

625
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:19,520
next opencraft and many more

626
00:24:19,679 --> 00:24:24,480
so the next question would be what does

627
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:26,460
product do we coordinate decision making

628
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:29,220
about the product which features get

629
00:24:26,460 --> 00:24:30,900
prioritized where we invest I mean these

630
00:24:29,220 --> 00:24:32,700
decisions are all Based on data on

631
00:24:30,900 --> 00:24:33,960
market research on user feedback and

632
00:24:32,700 --> 00:24:35,760
we&#39;ve been able to create channels that

633
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:37,140
we can actually aggregate this across

634
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:38,280
the community so we&#39;re pulling this data

635
00:24:37,140 --> 00:24:40,320
together from across many different

636
00:24:38,280 --> 00:24:43,340
sources which gives us a holistic view

637
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:43,340
of of the project

638
00:24:44,580 --> 00:24:48,360
and so this time last year the product

639
00:24:46,260 --> 00:24:49,919
working group was just an idea and we

640
00:24:48,360 --> 00:24:52,260
actually met for the first time in

641
00:24:49,919 --> 00:24:54,539
Lisbon to kind of brainstorm about what

642
00:24:52,260 --> 00:24:56,159
we would do what we would focus on in

643
00:24:54,539 --> 00:24:58,440
the first year

644
00:24:56,159 --> 00:25:01,200
and like Ed mentioned we have published

645
00:24:58,440 --> 00:25:03,059
our impact report but I wanted to

646
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:04,559
highlight a couple of accomplishments

647
00:25:03,059 --> 00:25:06,120
here that are actually tied to this

648
00:25:04,559 --> 00:25:09,500
bigger topic of building the product

649
00:25:06,120 --> 00:25:09,500
organization within the community

650
00:25:09,720 --> 00:25:14,159
and so in Lisbon we decided that we

651
00:25:12,059 --> 00:25:15,600
would focus on three priorities in the

652
00:25:14,159 --> 00:25:17,760
first year

653
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:19,919
number one was defining what the

654
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:21,960
platform is

655
00:25:19,919 --> 00:25:23,760
number two was streamlining the

656
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:26,880
contribution process specifically the

657
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:28,980
product review process of osprs

658
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:31,260
and the third was making the development

659
00:25:28,980 --> 00:25:32,940
feature development process visible and

660
00:25:31,260 --> 00:25:36,659
open

661
00:25:32,940 --> 00:25:38,100
and now a year later we have for this

662
00:25:36,659 --> 00:25:40,620
first one defining what the platform is

663
00:25:38,100 --> 00:25:43,080
we have of 57 which is an open addicts

664
00:25:40,620 --> 00:25:44,880
proposal which outlines a strategy and a

665
00:25:43,080 --> 00:25:47,419
plan to Define what our core product

666
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:47,419
will be

667
00:25:47,820 --> 00:25:52,860
we have a team that&#39;s dedicated to

668
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:55,020
streamlining this process to creating a

669
00:25:52,860 --> 00:25:58,260
workflow to help us review the massive

670
00:25:55,020 --> 00:26:00,720
backlog of PRS

671
00:25:58,260 --> 00:26:02,600
and we have a process that we&#39;ve tested

672
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:04,860
for making development visible

673
00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:07,380
we&#39;ve learned a lot from this process we

674
00:26:04,860 --> 00:26:08,640
still have a lot to learn but as a

675
00:26:07,380 --> 00:26:11,039
result now we have a product management

676
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:14,039
Wiki that has over half a dozen public

677
00:26:11,039 --> 00:26:15,480
approach memos user stories specs that

678
00:26:14,039 --> 00:26:19,400
outline what we&#39;re actually building

679
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:19,400
early on in the product process

680
00:26:19,620 --> 00:26:24,299
and I&#39;ll mention as well all three of

681
00:26:21,659 --> 00:26:25,679
these have dedicated talks during the

682
00:26:24,299 --> 00:26:27,720
conference over the over the next couple

683
00:26:25,679 --> 00:26:29,640
of days if you&#39;re interested in any of

684
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:32,779
these find the talk and join us and

685
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:32,779
we&#39;ll dive deeply

686
00:26:33,900 --> 00:26:37,200
so last year was all about laying the

687
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:39,120
foundation and this year is about

688
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:39,900
execution how are we going to do these

689
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:41,640
things

690
00:26:39,900 --> 00:26:43,799
we will

691
00:26:41,640 --> 00:26:45,000
continue to Define and actually build

692
00:26:43,799 --> 00:26:46,740
the core

693
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:49,260
core product offering

694
00:26:46,740 --> 00:26:51,360
we will clear the backlog of all of the

695
00:26:49,260 --> 00:26:52,620
PRS and also continue to make that

696
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:54,120
process better

697
00:26:52,620 --> 00:26:56,900
and we&#39;ll continue to do all of our

698
00:26:54,120 --> 00:26:56,900
development in the open

699
00:26:57,419 --> 00:27:01,799
okay so that&#39;s the past

700
00:26:59,820 --> 00:27:03,539
let&#39;s talk about what we&#39;re focusing on

701
00:27:01,799 --> 00:27:06,500
now and what we&#39;ll be focusing on in the

702
00:27:03,539 --> 00:27:06,500
next six to 12 months

703
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:12,059
so Ed mentioned earlier

704
00:27:09,320 --> 00:27:13,740
that we are prioritizing projects along

705
00:27:12,059 --> 00:27:15,240
that will support our mission right so

706
00:27:13,740 --> 00:27:17,220
our mission is to improve access to

707
00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:19,440
online learning and our mission is to

708
00:27:17,220 --> 00:27:21,240
improve the outcome or the impact of

709
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:22,559
online learning and I&#39;m going to talk

710
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:24,480
about a couple of areas that we&#39;re

711
00:27:22,559 --> 00:27:26,580
prioritizing for investment over the

712
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:28,500
next year that align with that mission

713
00:27:26,580 --> 00:27:30,419
and I&#39;ll also use them as examples to

714
00:27:28,500 --> 00:27:33,380
actually demonstrate how we are building

715
00:27:30,419 --> 00:27:33,380
these things in the open

716
00:27:33,659 --> 00:27:40,860
so on the access front one major Focus

717
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:42,539
for us is the core product offering

718
00:27:40,860 --> 00:27:44,159
so the core product offering is rooted

719
00:27:42,539 --> 00:27:46,620
in one of the big challenges of the

720
00:27:44,159 --> 00:27:47,960
platform and that is that the platform

721
00:27:46,620 --> 00:27:50,220
is a little bit difficult to Define

722
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:52,320
which may sound a little bit weird but

723
00:27:50,220 --> 00:27:55,500
it supports a lot of diverse use cases

724
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:57,059
right and because of this like that&#39;s

725
00:27:55,500 --> 00:27:59,220
great right but because of this it makes

726
00:27:57,059 --> 00:28:01,740
it a little bit challenging sometimes to

727
00:27:59,220 --> 00:28:03,240
install it&#39;s inefficient to customize

728
00:28:01,740 --> 00:28:04,919
but more importantly from a product

729
00:28:03,240 --> 00:28:06,480
perspective it can make it difficult to

730
00:28:04,919 --> 00:28:07,620
create a strategy like who are we

731
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:09,059
building this for and what are we

732
00:28:07,620 --> 00:28:10,679
building

733
00:28:09,059 --> 00:28:12,960
and so the goal of the core product

734
00:28:10,679 --> 00:28:14,940
offering is to define a clear set of

735
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:17,039
features that come supported in the out

736
00:28:14,940 --> 00:28:18,299
of the box Community install so it

737
00:28:17,039 --> 00:28:19,740
should be very clear to users what

738
00:28:18,299 --> 00:28:21,840
you&#39;re getting and why you&#39;re getting

739
00:28:19,740 --> 00:28:23,340
those features

740
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:25,980
on top of that we want to make it even

741
00:28:23,340 --> 00:28:27,840
easier to customize so we&#39;re going to be

742
00:28:25,980 --> 00:28:29,520
building a clear catalog of tools so

743
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:32,640
things like a tool a catalog of Xbox

744
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:34,260
catalogs of LTI apps plugins that will

745
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:36,240
help us to streamline and simplify the

746
00:28:34,260 --> 00:28:38,100
experience and to enable easier

747
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:39,779
customization so that we can support

748
00:28:38,100 --> 00:28:43,039
this diversity of use cases that are

749
00:28:39,779 --> 00:28:43,039
really at the heart of the narrative

750
00:28:43,860 --> 00:28:49,020
in terms of developing this in the open

751
00:28:46,159 --> 00:28:52,260
even though this is a product product

752
00:28:49,020 --> 00:28:53,220
project we we put it through the oep

753
00:28:52,260 --> 00:28:55,380
process

754
00:28:53,220 --> 00:28:58,080
because it introduces a lot of new terms

755
00:28:55,380 --> 00:29:00,120
a lot of new Concepts um the oop process

756
00:28:58,080 --> 00:29:02,820
is the open edx proposal process this

757
00:29:00,120 --> 00:29:04,260
enabled us to socialize it with the

758
00:29:02,820 --> 00:29:06,720
community on both the technical and the

759
00:29:04,260 --> 00:29:08,520
product side we were able to integrate a

760
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:10,220
lot of great feedback in that process so

761
00:29:08,520 --> 00:29:12,539
it helps us really shape it in real time

762
00:29:10,220 --> 00:29:13,980
and this is a really interesting model I

763
00:29:12,539 --> 00:29:16,919
think for us to explore going forward

764
00:29:13,980 --> 00:29:18,600
you know what other best practices or

765
00:29:16,919 --> 00:29:20,279
workflows exist in the open source

766
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:22,620
community and how can we bring product

767
00:29:20,279 --> 00:29:24,539
into those processes so this is one

768
00:29:22,620 --> 00:29:27,720
example um you can anyone can take a

769
00:29:24,539 --> 00:29:27,720
look at 57.

770
00:29:30,059 --> 00:29:35,399
another area of investment for us next

771
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:37,620
year is our taxonomy initiative our

772
00:29:35,399 --> 00:29:41,220
learning taxonomy initiative this aligns

773
00:29:37,620 --> 00:29:42,960
more with the impact side of the mission

774
00:29:41,220 --> 00:29:45,480
so with this project authors will be

775
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:47,460
able to align their content in courses

776
00:29:45,480 --> 00:29:48,960
to learning taxonomies

777
00:29:47,460 --> 00:29:51,659
um for example taxonomies around

778
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:53,580
competencies or taxonomies around skills

779
00:29:51,659 --> 00:29:56,760
and they&#39;ll be able to add tags as well

780
00:29:53,580 --> 00:29:58,440
in studio and in libraries

781
00:29:56,760 --> 00:30:00,720
there&#39;s a lot of benefits to this

782
00:29:58,440 --> 00:30:01,980
project one of them is that coupled with

783
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:04,380
the data project which I&#39;ll talk about

784
00:30:01,980 --> 00:30:06,419
in a minute taxonomies will enable

785
00:30:04,380 --> 00:30:08,399
instructors to better manage and track

786
00:30:06,419 --> 00:30:10,500
Learners as they move through content

787
00:30:08,399 --> 00:30:12,240
sequences and it&#39;ll be able to hold

788
00:30:10,500 --> 00:30:14,279
course teams accountable right our

789
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:18,440
students actually learning what the unit

790
00:30:14,279 --> 00:30:21,299
or the module promises promises to teach

791
00:30:18,440 --> 00:30:23,460
taxonomies will also help us to set the

792
00:30:21,299 --> 00:30:25,140
platform up and sort of forward-looking

793
00:30:23,460 --> 00:30:27,840
to better align with third-party

794
00:30:25,140 --> 00:30:29,580
adaptive tools and other services that

795
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:30,899
customize you know content

796
00:30:29,580 --> 00:30:34,100
recommendations based on learner

797
00:30:30,899 --> 00:30:34,100
profiles and learner interests

798
00:30:34,500 --> 00:30:39,299
in terms of developing this in the open

799
00:30:37,039 --> 00:30:40,860
this is part of our bigger modular

800
00:30:39,299 --> 00:30:42,179
learning initiative I mean we&#39;ve been

801
00:30:40,860 --> 00:30:45,419
developing this in the open from the

802
00:30:42,179 --> 00:30:47,820
get-go we put together a group of about

803
00:30:45,419 --> 00:30:48,899
eight to ten stakeholders from across

804
00:30:47,820 --> 00:30:51,000
the community across different

805
00:30:48,899 --> 00:30:53,220
organizations because we wanted to make

806
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:55,260
sure that the data we were getting would

807
00:30:53,220 --> 00:30:56,399
represent the majority of of the

808
00:30:55,260 --> 00:30:57,899
community wanted to make sure that the

809
00:30:56,399 --> 00:30:59,760
user stories we had were representative

810
00:30:57,899 --> 00:31:02,580
of of everyone here and all of the

811
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:03,779
clients that you serve

812
00:31:02,580 --> 00:31:06,059
um we put all of this on the product

813
00:31:03,779 --> 00:31:07,500
Wiki and so far all of the documents

814
00:31:06,059 --> 00:31:09,960
around this and related projects have

815
00:31:07,500 --> 00:31:12,059
generated over 100 views and about 30

816
00:31:09,960 --> 00:31:13,620
different comment threads which have

817
00:31:12,059 --> 00:31:16,159
also helped us to shape these projects

818
00:31:13,620 --> 00:31:16,159
in real time

819
00:31:18,059 --> 00:31:22,020
and finally a third area of investment

820
00:31:20,100 --> 00:31:23,880
for us which also aligns with the impact

821
00:31:22,020 --> 00:31:25,260
side of our mission is to improve

822
00:31:23,880 --> 00:31:27,539
learner Analytics

823
00:31:25,260 --> 00:31:29,820
we&#39;ll be replacing insights with ores

824
00:31:27,539 --> 00:31:32,340
which is the open open analytics

825
00:31:29,820 --> 00:31:34,260
reference system

826
00:31:32,340 --> 00:31:36,000
a couple things about this project we

827
00:31:34,260 --> 00:31:38,940
will be aligning the platform to open

828
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:41,039
data standards and this will unlock a

829
00:31:38,940 --> 00:31:42,240
lot of interesting and exciting

830
00:31:41,039 --> 00:31:45,299
opportunities around reporting because

831
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:47,580
we&#39;ll be able to report on get near

832
00:31:45,299 --> 00:31:49,860
real-time learner analytics which again

833
00:31:47,580 --> 00:31:51,120
coupled with things like the taxonomy

834
00:31:49,860 --> 00:31:53,039
projects now course teams will be able

835
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:54,419
to have better insight into learner

836
00:31:53,039 --> 00:31:56,159
engagement learner progress and how

837
00:31:54,419 --> 00:31:58,380
Learners are understanding the content

838
00:31:56,159 --> 00:31:59,640
at very granular levels so they can make

839
00:31:58,380 --> 00:32:02,120
decisions about their course in more

840
00:31:59,640 --> 00:32:02,120
real time

841
00:32:02,760 --> 00:32:06,659
in terms of developing this in the open

842
00:32:05,100 --> 00:32:08,460
um this initiative is being driven by

843
00:32:06,659 --> 00:32:10,140
the data working group and again their

844
00:32:08,460 --> 00:32:13,159
their boards and all of their their work

845
00:32:10,140 --> 00:32:13,159
is available in the public

846
00:32:14,220 --> 00:32:18,179
and if you&#39;d like a full view of all of

847
00:32:16,500 --> 00:32:19,679
the areas of investment these are some

848
00:32:18,179 --> 00:32:21,779
more highlights

849
00:32:19,679 --> 00:32:24,179
um the best place to go is the open edx

850
00:32:21,779 --> 00:32:26,159
roadmap

851
00:32:24,179 --> 00:32:28,140
um I remember standing up here at the

852
00:32:26,159 --> 00:32:29,880
conference last year saying that the

853
00:32:28,140 --> 00:32:31,559
road map at that point was kind of a

854
00:32:29,880 --> 00:32:33,419
little bit of an experiment and it was

855
00:32:31,559 --> 00:32:35,279
more of um at that point it was more

856
00:32:33,419 --> 00:32:36,419
like a directory of current initiatives

857
00:32:35,279 --> 00:32:37,620
right we were asking everybody to

858
00:32:36,419 --> 00:32:38,580
contribute the things that they were

859
00:32:37,620 --> 00:32:41,039
building

860
00:32:38,580 --> 00:32:42,659
and it is still that but I&#39;m also happy

861
00:32:41,039 --> 00:32:44,520
to say that we&#39;ve we&#39;ve moved beyond

862
00:32:42,659 --> 00:32:46,080
that as well as we get these products

863
00:32:44,520 --> 00:32:48,240
projects off the ground as we start to

864
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:49,500
build backlogs and prioritize the

865
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:51,360
roadmap is starting to develop a bit

866
00:32:49,500 --> 00:32:54,020
more of a strategic Arc as well which is

867
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:54,020
really exciting

868
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:58,620
and one of the questions that I&#39;ve heard

869
00:32:56,940 --> 00:33:00,179
quite a bit from folks is like how do I

870
00:32:58,620 --> 00:33:02,340
stay up to date how do I stay on top of

871
00:33:00,179 --> 00:33:04,380
everything that&#39;s happening and so I

872
00:33:02,340 --> 00:33:06,000
wanted to actually give a quick like 30

873
00:33:04,380 --> 00:33:07,440
second crash course on how to read the

874
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:10,140
road map well I&#39;ve got everyone&#39;s

875
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:11,640
attention here

876
00:33:10,140 --> 00:33:14,240
um so you can see that the roadmap is

877
00:33:11,640 --> 00:33:16,620
organized by platform area at the top

878
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:18,360
there&#39;s a tab for every major area of

879
00:33:16,620 --> 00:33:19,980
the platform and this is kind of your

880
00:33:18,360 --> 00:33:21,240
navigation through the roadmap if

881
00:33:19,980 --> 00:33:22,919
there&#39;s a specific area of the platform

882
00:33:21,240 --> 00:33:24,000
that you&#39;re interested in you can go to

883
00:33:22,919 --> 00:33:27,659
the tab

884
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:29,760
so you can see that this one is a

885
00:33:27,659 --> 00:33:32,179
this one is highlighting the the content

886
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:32,179
libraries

887
00:33:33,539 --> 00:33:38,580
every platform area has a set of tickets

888
00:33:36,299 --> 00:33:40,019
so these tickets are high level right

889
00:33:38,580 --> 00:33:42,720
they&#39;re meant to just capture an

890
00:33:40,019 --> 00:33:44,340
overview of the project and give you a

891
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:46,679
quick overview of what the impact and

892
00:33:44,340 --> 00:33:48,240
what the value of the project is

893
00:33:46,679 --> 00:33:49,919
if you&#39;re interested in diving more

894
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:52,980
deeply into the projects at a course

895
00:33:49,919 --> 00:33:54,600
grains view we also have a readme for

896
00:33:52,980 --> 00:33:57,059
every section of the platform where we

897
00:33:54,600 --> 00:33:58,679
link it out to the specific boards and

898
00:33:57,059 --> 00:34:01,260
so for example if you&#39;re interested in

899
00:33:58,679 --> 00:34:03,419
like the taxonomy project you can find a

900
00:34:01,260 --> 00:34:05,100
link to that particular board here and

901
00:34:03,419 --> 00:34:06,360
you can track at a more more detailed

902
00:34:05,100 --> 00:34:09,500
level all of the issues that we&#39;ve

903
00:34:06,360 --> 00:34:09,500
groomed where we&#39;re currently at

904
00:34:12,359 --> 00:34:16,320
and finally a quick reminder that the

905
00:34:14,460 --> 00:34:18,060
roadmap is a still a collaborative

906
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:19,740
effort and we need everybody&#39;s help to

907
00:34:18,060 --> 00:34:20,700
help us continue to build it and flesh

908
00:34:19,739 --> 00:34:22,980
it out

909
00:34:20,699 --> 00:34:24,839
there&#39;s two ways that you can

910
00:34:22,980 --> 00:34:26,480
participate in getting your your voice

911
00:34:24,839 --> 00:34:29,879
onto the roadmap

912
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:32,879
in the platform roadmap repo

913
00:34:29,879 --> 00:34:34,859
we have two templates that are meant to

914
00:34:32,879 --> 00:34:38,159
help you navigate your way through

915
00:34:34,859 --> 00:34:40,139
contributing the first template is an

916
00:34:38,159 --> 00:34:42,119
issue submission so if you have work

917
00:34:40,139 --> 00:34:44,159
that&#39;s already in progress if you have

918
00:34:42,119 --> 00:34:45,060
work that you&#39;d like to contribute you

919
00:34:44,159 --> 00:34:47,339
know put eventually through the pr

920
00:34:45,060 --> 00:34:49,679
process there&#39;s a template to help you

921
00:34:47,339 --> 00:34:52,040
add that at that contribution to the

922
00:34:49,679 --> 00:34:52,040
roadmap

923
00:34:52,080 --> 00:34:58,740
the second is a feature request

924
00:34:56,040 --> 00:35:00,599
so this is newer if you want to see

925
00:34:58,740 --> 00:35:02,640
something added to the roadmap but it&#39;s

926
00:35:00,599 --> 00:35:04,619
not there there&#39;s a ticket template as

927
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:06,420
well to help you you can add it to our

928
00:35:04,619 --> 00:35:08,580
backlog and we will

929
00:35:06,420 --> 00:35:10,380
um have it have it visible

930
00:35:08,580 --> 00:35:12,359
does this guarantee that we&#39;re going to

931
00:35:10,380 --> 00:35:15,720
build that feature no not necessarily

932
00:35:12,359 --> 00:35:17,700
it&#39;s up to the product organization of

933
00:35:15,720 --> 00:35:20,880
openedx to help us prioritize that

934
00:35:17,700 --> 00:35:22,980
backlog but this is the project that&#39;s a

935
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:25,200
duocracy right and if you want to

936
00:35:22,980 --> 00:35:27,599
influence which projects get prioritized

937
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:29,400
this is an open invitation right join

938
00:35:27,599 --> 00:35:33,320
the product working group that&#39;s the

939
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:33,320
best way to make your voice heard

940
00:35:35,579 --> 00:35:41,640

ninth grade

947
00:35:51,119 --> 00:35:54,900

00:36:09,119 --> 00:36:13,200
thank you um Adrian devison the

953
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:15,780
executive director of empower

954
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:17,579
Empower is a non-profit creating the

955
00:36:15,780 --> 00:36:18,480
school to Career pipeline for students

956
00:36:17,579 --> 00:36:20,640
of color

957
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:22,800
we teach software development as a

958
00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:25,200
multi-year program to help increase

959
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:27,540
diversity in Tech and generational

960
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:29,099
poverty cycles and create an equitable

961
00:36:27,540 --> 00:36:31,440
future for everybody

962
00:36:29,099 --> 00:36:32,940
our students join our program in ninth

963
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:34,740
grade and remain throughout throughout

964
00:36:32,940 --> 00:36:36,060
their whole High School career

965
00:36:34,740 --> 00:36:37,920
in ninth grade they learned the

966
00:36:36,060 --> 00:36:39,780
foundations of software development and

967
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:43,020
undergo leadership training

968
00:36:39,780 --> 00:36:45,300
in 10th Grade they think of app ideas to

969
00:36:43,020 --> 00:36:47,640
impact their community and then we have

970
00:36:45,300 --> 00:36:49,200
a pitch competition and whoever wins we

971
00:36:47,640 --> 00:36:51,300
actually build that app idea together

972
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:52,920
and the students then incorporate it so

973
00:36:51,300 --> 00:36:54,900
we increase the number of minority and

974
00:36:52,920 --> 00:36:57,780
women-owned businesses and show students

975
00:36:54,900 --> 00:36:59,880
the power in their and their work

976
00:36:57,780 --> 00:37:01,500
and the third year our students obtain

977
00:36:59,880 --> 00:37:03,420
High School internships with our

978
00:37:01,500 --> 00:37:05,280
partners and that helps our students

979
00:37:03,420 --> 00:37:07,680
bring additional income especially for

980
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:09,060
our students in low-income areas and at

981
00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:10,740
the same time make sure our students

982
00:37:09,060 --> 00:37:12,660
graduate one to two years of experience

983
00:37:10,740 --> 00:37:14,520
before they even leave High School

984
00:37:12,660 --> 00:37:17,220
they continue those internships into

985
00:37:14,520 --> 00:37:18,480
their final year and also learn you know

986
00:37:17,220 --> 00:37:20,640
professional networking and solve

987
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:22,020
business skills so when they graduate we

988
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:23,400
can work for our partners to ensure that

989
00:37:22,020 --> 00:37:25,619
they all have careers waiting on them

990
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:27,780
our current graduates make an average of

991
00:37:25,619 --> 00:37:31,020
seventy thousand dollars within one year

992
00:37:27,780 --> 00:37:33,180
of graduating high school

993
00:37:31,020 --> 00:37:34,619
in order to scale a program like this

994
00:37:33,180 --> 00:37:36,119
it&#39;s really hard to manually grade

995
00:37:34,619 --> 00:37:39,839
everything so I had to start getting

996
00:37:36,119 --> 00:37:41,280
creative and inspired by leak code I

997
00:37:39,839 --> 00:37:43,320
decided that we can create a platform

998
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:45,900
that allows teachers to create an

999
00:37:43,320 --> 00:37:48,240
assignment within a couple minutes and

1000
00:37:45,900 --> 00:37:50,700
have it auto graded uh by a remote

1001
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:53,160
server this would also allow us to

1002
00:37:50,700 --> 00:37:55,920
reduce costs by shipping every student a

1003
00:37:53,160 --> 00:37:58,440
Macbook and at the same time

1004
00:37:55,920 --> 00:38:00,180
we can um Support over 100 different

1005
00:37:58,440 --> 00:38:01,740
languages so we can keep adding courses

1006
00:38:00,180 --> 00:38:03,359
as we go along

1007
00:38:01,740 --> 00:38:05,339
and the spirit of democratizing

1008
00:38:03,359 --> 00:38:07,140
Education we made sure this was free and

1009
00:38:05,339 --> 00:38:11,000
open source available for everyone on

1010
00:38:07,140 --> 00:38:11,000
GitHub to contribute to and utilize

1011
00:38:11,220 --> 00:38:16,400
so here&#39;s a demo of coppin our platform

1012
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:20,640
we start on the assignments dashboard

1013
00:38:18,540 --> 00:38:23,099
and then we can go down and we can

1014
00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:25,079
actually create a new assignment

1015
00:38:23,099 --> 00:38:26,820
we give the assignment a title and we&#39;ll

1016
00:38:25,079 --> 00:38:28,380
start with hello world because we&#39;re all

1017
00:38:26,820 --> 00:38:30,720
developers here

1018
00:38:28,380 --> 00:38:33,180
we give it a reference ID and this was

1019
00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:35,880
what edx will use to know which problem

1020
00:38:33,180 --> 00:38:38,579
to solve you can give it a total

1021
00:38:35,880 --> 00:38:40,980
attempts which zero means unlimited and

1022
00:38:38,579 --> 00:38:43,140
anything above that is the actual number

1023
00:38:40,980 --> 00:38:44,280
then we use markdown to paste the

1024
00:38:43,140 --> 00:38:47,160
instructions

1025
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:48,839
a success message and a failure message

1026
00:38:47,160 --> 00:38:51,180
to encourage your students in case they

1027
00:38:48,839 --> 00:38:53,760
don&#39;t uh complete the problem

1028
00:38:51,180 --> 00:38:55,619
we can scroll down then and we go to our

1029
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:57,420
assignment codes where we can add Which

1030
00:38:55,619 --> 00:38:59,640
languages the students will complete it

1031
00:38:57,420 --> 00:39:01,079
in and any unit tests that are used to

1032
00:38:59,640 --> 00:39:03,480
grade this

1033
00:39:01,079 --> 00:39:05,220
so we select our language we can decide

1034
00:39:03,480 --> 00:39:07,020
if it&#39;s the primary language

1035
00:39:05,220 --> 00:39:10,800
we can then decide if it&#39;s injectable

1036
00:39:07,020 --> 00:39:12,540
code which means we will hide

1037
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:14,700
all the code you may need to run unit

1038
00:39:12,540 --> 00:39:15,960
tests and have these brackets and that&#39;s

1039
00:39:14,700 --> 00:39:17,220
all the student will actually see is

1040
00:39:15,960 --> 00:39:18,720
that empty space where the code&#39;s

1041
00:39:17,220 --> 00:39:21,060
injected

1042
00:39:18,720 --> 00:39:22,500
we can provide an optional solution code

1043
00:39:21,060 --> 00:39:24,000
in case you want your students to be

1044
00:39:22,500 --> 00:39:24,839
able to view the actual solution to the

1045
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:27,119
problem

1046
00:39:24,839 --> 00:39:29,640
and lastly we give our unit tests to

1047
00:39:27,119 --> 00:39:31,859
actually grade the assignment against

1048
00:39:29,640 --> 00:39:34,020
then we simply click save

1049
00:39:31,859 --> 00:39:36,240
you can add as many languages as you

1050
00:39:34,020 --> 00:39:37,859
want that are supported by your server

1051
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:41,099
and it&#39;s really easy to add a language

1052
00:39:37,859 --> 00:39:43,619
all you do is give it a name a mime

1053
00:39:41,099 --> 00:39:45,720
that&#39;s from code mirror a regex that

1054
00:39:43,619 --> 00:39:49,920
helps us parse the actual unit test

1055
00:39:45,720 --> 00:39:52,800
error and a code mirror URL

1056
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:55,800
and once we do that

1057
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:58,020
we can then go into seeing how um

1058
00:39:55,800 --> 00:40:00,300
we bring this live in edx

1059
00:39:58,020 --> 00:40:03,720
and so just like creating any other

1060
00:40:00,300 --> 00:40:04,740
problem uh from a x-block is go to

1061
00:40:03,720 --> 00:40:07,980
Advanced

1062
00:40:04,740 --> 00:40:11,400
you&#39;ll select Swift plugin

1063
00:40:07,980 --> 00:40:13,740
and then it&#39;ll load it into your screen

1064
00:40:11,400 --> 00:40:16,740
after that we click edit and all you

1065
00:40:13,740 --> 00:40:19,320
have to pass in is the reference ID the

1066
00:40:16,740 --> 00:40:21,720
URL to the cop in server

1067
00:40:19,320 --> 00:40:24,560
and then the API key given to your user

1068
00:40:21,720 --> 00:40:24,560
on coppin

1069
00:40:25,740 --> 00:40:30,900
and after that we can simply publish the

1070
00:40:28,500 --> 00:40:32,280
assignment and we&#39;ll see it

1071
00:40:30,900 --> 00:40:34,520
and we can actually view the live

1072
00:40:32,280 --> 00:40:34,520
version

1073
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:37,940
once our video catches up

1074
00:40:39,599 --> 00:40:44,220
and right here we see the markdown is

1075
00:40:41,880 --> 00:40:45,900
formatted as HTML

1076
00:40:44,220 --> 00:40:48,060
and we the student can select any

1077
00:40:45,900 --> 00:40:49,859
languages we only gave it one so they

1078
00:40:48,060 --> 00:40:52,560
can only select Swift

1079
00:40:49,859 --> 00:40:53,520
and then we can actually start writing

1080
00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:55,020
our code

1081
00:40:53,520 --> 00:40:57,060
now it&#39;s supposed to write hello world

1082
00:40:55,020 --> 00:40:59,040
but our student just wrote hello

1083
00:40:57,060 --> 00:41:01,920
so it&#39;s successfully outputted the code

1084
00:40:59,040 --> 00:41:03,359
but then when they go to test it we&#39;ll

1085
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:04,800
notice that it&#39;s going to give them an

1086
00:41:03,359 --> 00:41:07,200
error of course

1087
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:09,599
and so what it does is it tests the code

1088
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:10,800
on our our doctor server is what we

1089
00:41:09,599 --> 00:41:12,119
named it

1090
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:13,619
and it gives them back the unit test

1091
00:41:12,119 --> 00:41:15,060
failure

1092
00:41:13,619 --> 00:41:16,980
and so now the student can go and

1093
00:41:15,060 --> 00:41:19,260
correct the error

1094
00:41:16,980 --> 00:41:21,300
submit the code again

1095
00:41:19,260 --> 00:41:24,240
and now I want to successfully test and

1096
00:41:21,300 --> 00:41:27,500
pass it&#39;ll actually update the grade for

1097
00:41:24,240 --> 00:41:27,500
the student assignments for them

1098
00:41:28,079 --> 00:41:31,880
and yay now you&#39;re a developer

1099
00:41:31,980 --> 00:41:35,220
because we gave them an optional

1100
00:41:33,900 --> 00:41:36,839
solution code they can click the

1101
00:41:35,220 --> 00:41:39,240
solution tab to view what the solution

1102
00:41:36,839 --> 00:41:41,160
was as well

1103
00:41:39,240 --> 00:41:42,060
and so in less than three minutes you

1104
00:41:41,160 --> 00:41:44,579
can create

1105
00:41:42,060 --> 00:41:47,700
and and allow your students to run

1106
00:41:44,579 --> 00:41:50,420
programming assignments on your server

1107
00:41:47,700 --> 00:41:55,309
so how you can help

1108
00:41:50,420 --> 00:41:55,309
[Applause]

1109
00:41:55,920 --> 00:42:00,540
well yeah how you can help

1110
00:41:58,339 --> 00:42:01,980
internships for any of you who know of

1111
00:42:00,540 --> 00:42:03,900
any our students are always looking for

1112
00:42:01,980 --> 00:42:06,599
internships what I like to tell people

1113
00:42:03,900 --> 00:42:08,579
is in the school we operate primarily

1114
00:42:06,599 --> 00:42:11,220
out of in South Atlanta High School the

1115
00:42:08,579 --> 00:42:12,960
average income for a household as a

1116
00:42:11,220 --> 00:42:13,920
total household income is ten dollars an

1117
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:16,619
hour

1118
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:18,720
so lots of our students don&#39;t eat or

1119
00:42:16,619 --> 00:42:21,900
they don&#39;t have clothes and the average

1120
00:42:18,720 --> 00:42:24,599
software development intern makes 25 an

1121
00:42:21,900 --> 00:42:26,700
hour so providing an internship to these

1122
00:42:24,599 --> 00:42:29,339
students you&#39;re effectively tripling the

1123
00:42:26,700 --> 00:42:32,640
income of that household for the year

1124
00:42:29,339 --> 00:42:34,200
donations go to uh buying more MacBooks

1125
00:42:32,640 --> 00:42:36,660
for the students we provide them all

1126
00:42:34,200 --> 00:42:38,099
with free MacBooks headphones internet

1127
00:42:36,660 --> 00:42:40,260
grants if they don&#39;t have internet at

1128
00:42:38,099 --> 00:42:42,000
home meal plans for our low-income

1129
00:42:40,260 --> 00:42:43,920
students and clothes for those who don&#39;t

1130
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:47,099
have them as well

1131
00:42:43,920 --> 00:42:48,660
and volunteers developing Captain took a

1132
00:42:47,099 --> 00:42:49,980
long time and if you check my GitHub

1133
00:42:48,660 --> 00:42:51,040
history I was still submitting stuff

1134
00:42:49,980 --> 00:42:54,560
last night

1135
00:42:51,040 --> 00:42:54,560
[Laughter]

1136
00:42:55,520 --> 00:43:00,960
so anyone who&#39;s good with security I&#39;d

1137
00:42:59,579 --> 00:43:03,300
love for you to come on because I was

1138
00:43:00,960 --> 00:43:05,640
not a cyber security engineer

1139
00:43:03,300 --> 00:43:07,740
um ux as well that was never my strong

1140
00:43:05,640 --> 00:43:10,079
point but writing the code I got that

1141
00:43:07,740 --> 00:43:12,599
done and so um I&#39;d love for you to come

1142
00:43:10,079 --> 00:43:15,180
in and help out help build coppin into

1143
00:43:12,599 --> 00:43:16,130
something even bigger

1144
00:43:15,180 --> 00:43:30,060
thank you

1145
00:43:16,130 --> 00:43:32,520
[Applause]

1146
00:43:30,060 --> 00:43:34,319
so we&#39;re all going to be up here for

1147
00:43:32,520 --> 00:43:37,020
questions feel free to ask questions of

1148
00:43:34,319 --> 00:43:40,280
myself Jenna or Adrian that was that was

1149
00:43:37,020 --> 00:43:40,280
fantastic thank you

1150
00:43:41,040 --> 00:43:45,000
and there are mics down here so please

1151
00:43:43,260 --> 00:43:48,660
please come in the mic so we can record

1152
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:50,280
your question if you have one

1153
00:43:48,660 --> 00:43:51,900
you have a question raise your hand

1154
00:43:50,280 --> 00:43:55,160
anyone

1155
00:43:51,900 --> 00:43:55,160
no they nailed it

1156
00:43:58,920 --> 00:44:01,640
are these live

1157
00:44:02,460 --> 00:44:07,740
I didn&#39;t see one and maybe I missed it

1158
00:44:04,140 --> 00:44:09,960
in the slide is there a URL or a QR code

1159
00:44:07,740 --> 00:44:11,160
for Empower

1160
00:44:09,960 --> 00:44:13,640
um yeah I should have put one in the

1161
00:44:11,160 --> 00:44:16,640
slide huh but um

1162
00:44:13,640 --> 00:44:16,640
empowerco.org

1163
00:44:16,819 --> 00:44:21,540
empowrco.org and I&#39;ll be sure to you can

1164
00:44:20,040 --> 00:44:23,460
also Google that and you&#39;ll find the

1165
00:44:21,540 --> 00:44:26,180
GitHub that&#39;s cop in and the rest of our

1166
00:44:23,460 --> 00:44:26,180
servers on it

1167
00:44:27,500 --> 00:44:32,280
I want to ask Adrian how you do

1168
00:44:30,420 --> 00:44:34,140
presentations that smoothly I&#39;m I&#39;m

1169
00:44:32,280 --> 00:44:36,560
inspired in a number of ways by you

1170
00:44:34,140 --> 00:44:36,560
right now

1171
00:44:48,480 --> 00:44:53,220
um obviously a generative ADI is a

1172
00:44:51,300 --> 00:44:57,480
buzzword recently

1173
00:44:53,220 --> 00:45:01,680
um is there any plan to incorporate AI

1174
00:44:57,480 --> 00:45:04,339
tools into the product Romance

1175
00:45:01,680 --> 00:45:06,900
a great question and

1176
00:45:04,339 --> 00:45:09,599
not at the moment

1177
00:45:06,900 --> 00:45:11,819
um I was just going to say like as Jenna

1178
00:45:09,599 --> 00:45:15,720
was was unpacking for us the the road

1179
00:45:11,819 --> 00:45:18,300
map is generated by this group of people

1180
00:45:15,720 --> 00:45:20,040
here and not just the the folks at the

1181
00:45:18,300 --> 00:45:21,599
front of the room so

1182
00:45:20,040 --> 00:45:24,060
um

1183
00:45:21,599 --> 00:45:25,260
there&#39;s probably a unpopular opinion

1184
00:45:24,060 --> 00:45:27,180
since everybody&#39;s so excited about

1185
00:45:25,260 --> 00:45:29,579
generative AI right now but I think

1186
00:45:27,180 --> 00:45:31,079
let&#39;s let&#39;s think about the value we

1187
00:45:29,579 --> 00:45:32,640
want to provide to our Learners and how

1188
00:45:31,079 --> 00:45:34,560
we want to change their lives rather

1189
00:45:32,640 --> 00:45:37,440
than finding a way to use a technology

1190
00:45:34,560 --> 00:45:39,599
that really looks really cool but if we

1191
00:45:37,440 --> 00:45:41,400
have ideas about how we will really

1192
00:45:39,599 --> 00:45:42,839
impact the lives of our Learners with

1193
00:45:41,400 --> 00:45:46,260
generative AI let&#39;s get them on the

1194
00:45:42,839 --> 00:45:48,180
roadmap and let&#39;s get everybody kind of

1195
00:45:46,260 --> 00:45:49,800
refining those ideas and helping us

1196
00:45:48,180 --> 00:45:52,400
prioritize them and understanding what

1197
00:45:49,800 --> 00:45:52,400
we should be building

1198
00:45:54,119 --> 00:45:59,160
yeah so I have a question for you Jenna

1199
00:45:55,980 --> 00:46:01,740
I&#39;m really Amazed by what you achieved

1200
00:45:59,160 --> 00:46:04,079
in just one year I&#39;m curious to have

1201
00:46:01,740 --> 00:46:06,240
your perspective on what are the unique

1202
00:46:04,079 --> 00:46:09,060
challenges that you would face on

1203
00:46:06,240 --> 00:46:12,300
defining a product for an open source

1204
00:46:09,060 --> 00:46:16,260
Community where people can just join in

1205
00:46:12,300 --> 00:46:18,180
and propose to to build stuff that

1206
00:46:16,260 --> 00:46:20,700
that&#39;s not that&#39;s not necessarily on the

1207
00:46:18,180 --> 00:46:22,260
roadmap yeah that&#39;s a great question I

1208
00:46:20,700 --> 00:46:24,780
think one of the biggest challenges that

1209
00:46:22,260 --> 00:46:25,920
we&#39;ve run into which is kind of it&#39;s you

1210
00:46:24,780 --> 00:46:27,000
know challenges are always opportunities

1211
00:46:25,920 --> 00:46:28,260
right

1212
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:30,180
um but the biggest challenge is that

1213
00:46:28,260 --> 00:46:32,220
there are so many use cases that the

1214
00:46:30,180 --> 00:46:35,280
platform is used for which is great

1215
00:46:32,220 --> 00:46:38,160
right but it presents some challenges in

1216
00:46:35,280 --> 00:46:41,339
terms of deciding what we prioritize

1217
00:46:38,160 --> 00:46:43,740
um a couple of examples right we&#39;ve got

1218
00:46:41,339 --> 00:46:45,540
the platform is running moocs and online

1219
00:46:43,740 --> 00:46:47,160
degrees right those are two very very

1220
00:46:45,540 --> 00:46:48,660
different sets of features that are

1221
00:46:47,160 --> 00:46:49,819
required to make those use cases

1222
00:46:48,660 --> 00:46:52,619
successful

1223
00:46:49,819 --> 00:46:54,300
but in terms of this this kind of goes

1224
00:46:52,619 --> 00:46:55,560
to the core product offering which is

1225
00:46:54,300 --> 00:46:56,579
one of the things I touched on what

1226
00:46:55,560 --> 00:46:58,740
we&#39;ll talk about this more later

1227
00:46:56,579 --> 00:47:00,359
tomorrow as well one of the the

1228
00:46:58,740 --> 00:47:01,980
strategies for the platform is that we

1229
00:47:00,359 --> 00:47:04,140
want to simplify it so that we&#39;ve got a

1230
00:47:01,980 --> 00:47:06,300
core that can support as much diversity

1231
00:47:04,140 --> 00:47:08,940
as possible and this concept of the

1232
00:47:06,300 --> 00:47:11,220
catalog system where we can be adding

1233
00:47:08,940 --> 00:47:12,599
indexing and adding tools that you can

1234
00:47:11,220 --> 00:47:14,400
use that are based on the type of

1235
00:47:12,599 --> 00:47:16,020
customization you want to build so what

1236
00:47:14,400 --> 00:47:18,000
you&#39;re teaching or the type of teaching

1237
00:47:16,020 --> 00:47:20,520
that you&#39;re doing so the idea is that we

1238
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:22,500
simplify in order to broaden out again

1239
00:47:20,520 --> 00:47:23,940
and I think that&#39;s that&#39;s one of the

1240
00:47:22,500 --> 00:47:26,339
strategies that we&#39;ve used to to

1241
00:47:23,940 --> 00:47:28,260
approach that but relatedly though is

1242
00:47:26,339 --> 00:47:29,460
that there&#39;s because there&#39;s so many use

1243
00:47:28,260 --> 00:47:31,079
cases they&#39;re coming from so many

1244
00:47:29,460 --> 00:47:33,240
different organizations so we&#39;re not

1245
00:47:31,079 --> 00:47:34,920
just building for one particular set of

1246
00:47:33,240 --> 00:47:36,720
customers or one set of clients or one

1247
00:47:34,920 --> 00:47:39,300
one group of people we&#39;re building for

1248
00:47:36,720 --> 00:47:41,520
everybody like exponentially and so

1249
00:47:39,300 --> 00:47:44,040
working with different methods to try

1250
00:47:41,520 --> 00:47:45,480
and gather user stories from various

1251
00:47:44,040 --> 00:47:47,099
stakeholders across the community has

1252
00:47:45,480 --> 00:47:50,579
been one tactic that we&#39;ve used to try

1253
00:47:47,099 --> 00:47:52,140
and get a broader representation of you

1254
00:47:50,579 --> 00:47:54,240
know needs and pain points across the

1255
00:47:52,140 --> 00:47:56,640
community but yeah we&#39;re always open to

1256
00:47:54,240 --> 00:47:58,859
continuing to like evolve those Concepts

1257
00:47:56,640 --> 00:48:00,000
and ideas and you know hopefully we&#39;ll

1258
00:47:58,859 --> 00:48:01,680
be able to tap into some more

1259
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:02,940
experimental modes in the next year as

1260
00:48:01,680 --> 00:48:05,040
well

1261
00:48:02,940 --> 00:48:08,000
we have one last question

1262
00:48:05,040 --> 00:48:08,000
from anyone

1263
00:48:11,339 --> 00:48:17,280
I would love to hear about one or two of

1264
00:48:13,980 --> 00:48:20,540
the student app ideas that Empower that

1265
00:48:17,280 --> 00:48:20,540
the students wanted to build

1266
00:48:20,940 --> 00:48:25,920
yeah yeah definitely so the one we&#39;re

1267
00:48:23,460 --> 00:48:26,940
building now is the students decided

1268
00:48:25,920 --> 00:48:28,859
that

1269
00:48:26,940 --> 00:48:32,520
um job boards are just boring for them

1270
00:48:28,859 --> 00:48:34,740
they don&#39;t find indeed and monster and

1271
00:48:32,520 --> 00:48:38,400
all those entertaining to use so they&#39;re

1272
00:48:34,740 --> 00:48:41,160
basically making a job board for their

1273
00:48:38,400 --> 00:48:43,680
generation where you can apply kind of

1274
00:48:41,160 --> 00:48:45,960
how you would use tick tock you can uh

1275
00:48:43,680 --> 00:48:48,119
companies would show you cool trendy

1276
00:48:45,960 --> 00:48:49,859
videos of their workplace and your

1277
00:48:48,119 --> 00:48:51,480
application would start by an

1278
00:48:49,859 --> 00:48:53,040
introduction using that kind of same

1279
00:48:51,480 --> 00:48:55,380
video technology where you show short

1280
00:48:53,040 --> 00:48:56,940
clips of yourself and what you&#39;ve done

1281
00:48:55,380 --> 00:48:58,800
and then after that of course you still

1282
00:48:56,940 --> 00:49:00,540
have your resume but it kind of makes a

1283
00:48:58,800 --> 00:49:02,220
more personal approach to job

1284
00:49:00,540 --> 00:49:04,800
applications in a way that speaks to

1285
00:49:02,220 --> 00:49:08,579
their generation and so that one to me

1286
00:49:04,800 --> 00:49:11,040
was really cool and um the cohort before

1287
00:49:08,579 --> 00:49:12,900
them they that was the middle of the

1288
00:49:11,040 --> 00:49:14,520
pandemic and they had trouble making

1289
00:49:12,900 --> 00:49:15,240
friends as they were going through High

1290
00:49:14,520 --> 00:49:17,460
School

1291
00:49:15,240 --> 00:49:19,859
they had additional trouble because they

1292
00:49:17,460 --> 00:49:23,280
couldn&#39;t get outside and so they decided

1293
00:49:19,859 --> 00:49:25,380
to create a skating app that its whole

1294
00:49:23,280 --> 00:49:27,359
purpose was to get anybody who like to

1295
00:49:25,380 --> 00:49:29,280
ride wheels on bicycles skateboards or

1296
00:49:27,359 --> 00:49:31,680
anything to be able to come together and

1297
00:49:29,280 --> 00:49:33,180
to kind of throw off skating events and

1298
00:49:31,680 --> 00:49:36,060
so um they had a couple of different

1299
00:49:33,180 --> 00:49:36,900
unique ideas and so I&#39;m really proud to

1300
00:49:36,060 --> 00:49:38,880
um

1301
00:49:36,900 --> 00:49:40,680
to be able to watch it grow and they

1302
00:49:38,880 --> 00:49:44,839
have a bunch of other ideas and I still

1303
00:49:40,680 --> 00:49:44,839
hope they create that weren&#39;t chosen so

1304
00:49:45,960 --> 00:49:50,949
[Applause]
