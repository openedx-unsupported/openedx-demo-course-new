  <h4><strong>Sonnet 27 - William Shakespeare</strong></h4>
<p style="font-style:italic;">Weary with toil, I haste me to my bed,<br/>
The dear repose for limbs with travel tired;<br/>
But then begins a journey in my head<br/>
To work my mind, when body's work's expired:<br/>
For then my thoughts--from far where I abide--<br/>

Pilgrimages were taken to a holy place, like a church or a shrine, and often involved weeks of traveling by foot or on horseback to show devotion.

And keep my drooping eyelids open wide,<br/>
Looking on darkness which the blind do see:<br/>
Save that my soul's imaginary sight<br/>
Presents thy shadow to my sightless view,<br/>

  Lo! thus, by day my limbs, by night my mind,<br/>
  For thee, and for myself, no quiet find.
