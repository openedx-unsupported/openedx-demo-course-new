      <prompt>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;In the box below, enter a sentence or two about how you intend to use the Open edX platform. If you're not sure yet, share any ideas you have for what the ideal learning platform could look like instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We've kept the rubric on this very simple, and you'll need to grade at least 1 other person in order to get your results, and only one person needs to grade you, but you can (and should!) set these thresholds higher on your own courses.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
