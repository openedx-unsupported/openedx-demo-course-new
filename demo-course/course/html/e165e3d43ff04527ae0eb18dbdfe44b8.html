<p>The <strong class="blue-text">Poll </strong>component allows you to pose simple questions for your learners, allowing them to vote for their favorite answer from a predefined list.</p>
<p>This tool is exceptionally useful for teeing up discussions as you'll see in the example below! Unlike most other social tools, Polls can be also useful in long-running self-paced courses, allowing you to slowly collect results from your learners over a long period of time as they pass through the content, and allowing them to leave something behind for future learners taking that same course. Members of the course team can export the results of these polls at any time allowing you to do in-depth analysis of poll results at your leisure.</p>

<h4>Best Practices</h4>
<ul>
<li>Don't ask questions that have a single correct answer, else almost all votes will be for the same thing!</li>
<li>Make sure all of your poll options are reasonable responses to the question and aren't just objectively wrong.</li>
<li>'Seed' your results with a few answers using staff or testing accounts so that the first learner voting has something to look at when they view the results.</li>
</ul>
