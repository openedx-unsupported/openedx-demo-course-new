<p>The next component demonstrates a more advanced and flexible way of integrating code assessment into the Open edX® platform. It is an instance of an open source IDE called OpenJupyter which is graciously hosted for this demo course by <a href="https://open.hpi.de/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">openHPI</a>. </p>
<p>The assessment will open in a new tab but be able to return a grade back to the Open edX® LMS at the end of the exercise. </p>
<p>You can also view a video of the process just below the assessment. </p>
