<h4>Course Community Moderators</h4>
</div>
<p>Sometimes, learners demonstrate that they're exceptionally engaged with discussion forums, and can even be trusted to perform moderation tasks on your behalf!</p>
<p>For this reason, Open edX discussions include the <strong>Community TA</strong> role, which is assigned in the same way as a discussion moderator and provides similar powers within your discussion forums. This role is intended for members of your learning community who demonstrate exceptional commitment to their peers, allowing your learners to take ownership of their discussions (and reducing some of the load on your discussion moderators at the same time)!</p>
<p>With great power comes great responsibility, and the Community TA feature should be used with care, but it can be a powerful way to reward the very best of your learners, or even allow the wider cohort to elect community representatives within your course.</p>
