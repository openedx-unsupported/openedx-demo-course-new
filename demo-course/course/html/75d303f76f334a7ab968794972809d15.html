<p><strong>Posts </strong>are the standard type of discussion starter. They allow learners to make a post which can be replied to and discussed.</p>

<p><strong>Questions</strong> are a special type of post where learners are able to ask a question in order to get an answer. Staff and the original poster can mark any response as the answer to their question, allowing your courses to use discussions for peer-led Q&amp;A, as well as fielding common questions as a community.</p>
