<div class="course-structure">
<p>You made it!</p>
<p>This content is only available to staff and learners who have completed the previous subsection and achieved a passing grade. In Studio you'll be able to see that this content has the prerequisite set:</p>
<div class="boxed-image">
<p><img src="/static/prerequisite.png" alt="The subsection in Studio, with the text 'Prerequisite: other learning tools'" /></p>
</div>
<p style="display: flex; align-items: center;">By accessing the settings for this subsection via the cogwheel ( <span class="blue-text icon fa fa-gear" aria-hidden="true"></span> ) icon, you can see what exactly governs our prerequisite:</p>
<div class="boxed-image">
<p><img src="/static/prerequisite-settings.png" alt="The settings for the prerequisite in Studio, displaying the values of 100% progress and 100% grade as the requirements." /></p>
</div>
<p>As you can see, there are two factors that can be used either individually or combined together to form a prerequisite:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Minimum score</strong> only allows learners access when a percentage score within the chosen subsection is reached.</li>
<li><strong>Minimum completion </strong>only allows learners access when their completion % for the chosen subsection reaches the threshold.</li>
</ul>
<p>This means you can use various combinations for scenarios such as:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>100% Minimum Score, 0% Minimum completion</strong> - The "Mastery Path" experience - content that is intended for learners who achieve the maximum grade on a graded activity.</li>
<li><strong>0% Minimum Score, 100% completion</strong> - "You must watch this video to continue."</li>
<li><strong>70% Minimum Score, 100% completion</strong> - "You must complete and pass the quiz to proceed to the next module."</li>
</ul>
