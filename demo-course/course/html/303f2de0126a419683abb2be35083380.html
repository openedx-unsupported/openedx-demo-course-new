<p>If you can't find the answer to your question anywhere, and your provider isn't able to help, then asking the community is a great way to get a discussion going. If you are having an issue, chances are others are also looking for the answer or have already found a solution that they can share. </p>
<p>There are two main ways to ask a question in the community:</p>
<ul>
<li>Post on the discussion forums over on <a href="https://discuss.openedx.org/" alt="Open edX Discussion FOrum" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Discuss.OpenedX.org</a></li>
<li>Post in a relevant channel on Slack by <a href="https://openedx.org/slack" alt="Open edX Slack COmmunity" target="_blank" rel="noopener">accepting this invitation</a> to join our community channels</li>
</ul>
<p>Make sure you search for keywords related to your question first as it may have already been asked and answered. Please remember to follow the community <a href="https://openedx.org/code-of-conduct/" target="_blank" alt="Open edX Code of conduct GUide" rel="noopener">code of conduct</a> when posting. </p>
