<h3>XBlocks</h3>
<p>One example of the way the skills and expertise of the open source community enhance the learner experience is the XBlock architecture. Community members have created XBlocks to allow for additional customization in courses, and you can use them too.  XBlocks are "pluggable" components that can be installed to enable additional features in your course. You've already seen some of them in this course! Some of the most popular and useful XBlocks include:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/openedx/xblock-google-drive" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Drive</a> - Embed Google Documents or Google Calendar within your course</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/edly-io/h5pxblock" target="_blank" rel="noopener">H5P</a> - Host and play <a href="https://h5p.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">H5P</a> content in your Open edX® instance.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/openedx-unsupported/xblock-adventure" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Choose your own Adventure</a> - Create a simple choose your own adventure style simulation.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/overhangio/openedx-scorm-xblock" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SCORM </a>- Host and run SCORM content in your Open edX® instance. It will save student state and report scores to the progress tab of the course. Currently supports SCORM 1.2 and SCORM 2004 standard.</li>
</ul>
<p>Most XBlocks are built in such a way that they can easily plug into the Open edX platform, enabling you to add tools without requiring extensive integration efforts.
