<p>Let's look at some other social tools you can use to make use of the most powerful learning assets at your disposal - your learners.</p>
<p>Online learning can be isolating and it can be hard to stay engaged in a course when you feel alone. Discussions are great for alleviating this, but can be intimidating to some learners, and social learning activities allow your learners to engage with each other for specific learning purposes and feel like part of a wider learning cohort. This in turn increases engagement, retention and overall learner happiness! So where you can, look for opportunities to include <strong class="blue-text">social learning</strong> in your Open edX courses.</p>
<p>Most of the activities and tools we'll be covering in this subsection will only really work if your courses have concurrent learners, so use them with caution on self-paced courses that might not have an active group of learners.</p>
