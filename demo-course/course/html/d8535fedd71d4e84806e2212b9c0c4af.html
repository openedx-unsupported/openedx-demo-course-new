<p><img style="float: right; margin: 0 0 3% 3%; max-width: 265px; width: 30%;" src="/static/edX_logo.png" alt="The edx.org logo" />edX®, or <a href="https://edx.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener">edX.org</a>, is the online learning platform from world-leading digital education company 2U, Inc. </p>
<p>edX.org was the original developer for the Open edX® software, which it released as open source in 2013. Since that time, edX.org functions as a very important stakeholder in the Open edX® community, but it is not an <em>owner</em> of the software itself.</p>
<p>Today, edX.org maintains its own deployment of the Open edX® platform and works with a number of <a href="https://www.edx.org/schools-partners#membership" target="_blank" rel="noopener">partner institutions</a> to deliver high-quality MOOCs and other learning experiences to students across the globe. </p>
