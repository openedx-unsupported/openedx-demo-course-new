<h3>Units</h3>
<p>Units are pages of content which exist within subsections. At the top of this page there is a horizontal navigation bar with blocks shown across it. That navigation bar shows all of the units present within the subsection you are currently in, with each unit represented by a block and each icon dynamically chosen based on the type of content present in that unit.</p>
<p>A unit can be made up of any number of different components, allowing you create entirely custom learning experiences on each page.</p>
