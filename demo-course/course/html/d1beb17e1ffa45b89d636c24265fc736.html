<p>The <strong>Staff-Graded Assignment</strong> XBlock is another third-party component that was originally created by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and provides a light-weight alternative to Open Response Assessments. Learners can upload a file that is then simply given a numerical grade by course staff.</p>
<p>This XBlock is installed by default, so you will not need to install it, but you may find the link to the repository on GitHub useful.</p>
