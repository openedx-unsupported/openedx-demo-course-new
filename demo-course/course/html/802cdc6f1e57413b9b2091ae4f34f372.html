<h3>Subsections</h3>
<p>Sections are divided into subsections, which in turn contain one or more units. A subsection may represent a topic in your course, or another organizing principle. The subsection you are in now is called "the Structure of the Open edX® platform". Subsections are sometimes also referred to by Open edX® users as "sequences", "lessons", or "activities".</p>
<p>Subsections allow you to set visibility rules and release dates for all the content within that subsection, so that you don't have to set it at the unit level. Grades are also assigned at the subsection level. That way, a subsection can have multiple units with multiple types of content that all roll up into one graded element. For example, you might have a weekly assessment that includes some multiple choice questions and a reading assignment, and you want a student's performance on those items to all count as a single weekly assessment. </p>
