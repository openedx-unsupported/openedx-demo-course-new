<p>A <strong>multi-select multiple choice problem, </strong>also known as a "checkbox" problem, functions similarly to a single-select multiple choice problem but requires that learners select a combination of correct answers to answer the question instead of just one. All the correct answers must be selected for a checkbox problem to be considered correct.</p>
<p>Rich text, images, hints, and feedback can all be incorporated into multiple choice questions. </p>
