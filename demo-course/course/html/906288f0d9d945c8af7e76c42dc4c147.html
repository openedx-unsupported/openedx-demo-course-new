<h3>In-Content vs. General Topics</h3>
<p><strong>In-Content Topics</strong> function the way you've just seen, they put the discussion topic within the content itself, focusing the discussion and allowing learners to participate without breaking the flow of their learning.</p>
<p>Examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>Week 1 &gt; Introduce yourself</li>
<li>Week 7 &gt; Key Factors Influencing the Fall of the Roman Empire</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>General Topics</strong> can be defined on a course-by-course basis and allow you to have high-level topics that are available at all times, unconnected to any specific content.</p>
<p>Examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>General</li>
<li>Tech Support</li>
<li>Off Topic</li>
</ul>
<p>No matter the topic type, you can see all discussion topics in your course by selecting the <strong>Discussions</strong> tab at the top of the page.</p>
