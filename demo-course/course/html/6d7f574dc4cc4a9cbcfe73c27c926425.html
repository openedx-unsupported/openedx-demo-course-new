<p>Video transcripts are an important part of an educational video. <strong class="blue-text">Transcripts and subtitles</strong> help learners with hearing impairments understand audio content and they are helpful for learners who speak other languages, as well as being shown to increase the information retention levels of <strong>all</strong> learners. The Open edX video player goes beyond this by providing an interactive transcript, dynamically generated using standard SRT files. Try navigating the video <span style="font-size: 1em;">below by clicking through the interactive transcript!</span></p>
<p>If your transcript is not already open, you can open it up by clicking the <span class="icon fa fa-quote-left" aria-hidden="true"></span> button on the far right of the player. Your preferences for both transcripts and closed captions will be remembered for future videos.</p>
