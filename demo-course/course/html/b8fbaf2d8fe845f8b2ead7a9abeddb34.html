<h3>Sections</h3>
<p>A section is the largest organizational piece of an Open edX course. Sections contain content and are commonly used to organize "Modules" or "Weeks" in a course. </p>
<p>Sections are used to control release dates and visibility for all content they contain and to provide a logical structure for learners. The section you are currently in is called "Module 1: Introduction to the Open edX® platform".</p>
