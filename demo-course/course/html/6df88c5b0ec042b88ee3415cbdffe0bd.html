<p><strong>Subsection Pre-Requisites</strong><b> </b>allows you to limit access to certain content until your learner has achieved either a minimum score or a minimum completion percentage in a subsection you designate. For example, this can be used if you want to make sure they check off an honor code before proceeding into the course. Or, if you need to ensure that your student watches a video before proceeding to the next section.Â </p>
