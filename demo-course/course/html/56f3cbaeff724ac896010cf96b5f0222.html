<h3>Best Practices</h3>
<p>The following guidelines and best practices are recommended for your course images:</p>
<ul>
<li>Do not "upscale" your images - keep their maximum dimensions no larger than the original image, or you'll lose quality.</li>
<li>Images wider than 944px will be scaled down to fit, so you should scale down your images before uploading them in order to save on load times.</li>
<li>Images up to 1988px may look slightly clearer on high pixel-density screens, but most learners do not possess these.</li>
<li>For in-course images, do not exceed 512kb per image where possible. The smaller the file size, the better, as this will affect load times and data usage for your learners. Studio will let you upload larger images, but your learners will not thank you for it!</li>
<li>Ensure all images have clear and concise alternative text for learners with accessibility needs, unless they are purely decorative or they are already described by the surrounding text.</li>
</ul>
