<p>You can find documentation in a variety of places:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://docs.openedx.org/en/latest/" alt="Open edX Docs site" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Docs.OpenedX.org</a> is the main documentation site for the Open edX platform.</li>
<li>2U provides their own documentation for edX.org, which can be found at <a href="https://docs.edx.org/" alt="EdX Docs Site" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Docs.edX.org</a>. Just remember that the information found there is often specific to edX.org's version of the platform.</li>
<li>Google it! There's a wealth of information available online from various providers and experts outside of the official documentation sites.</li>
</ul>
<p>If reading and searching through the available doesn't help, then you're going to need some more help. Let's look now at <strong>who </strong>can help.</p>
