<p>The <strong class="blue-text">Randomized Content</strong> block allows you to randomly load in problems from a content library increasing the likelihood that each learner's combination of questions will be different. This helps to ensure that your quizzes are kept fair and discourages cheating (if your 'B' isn't the same as my 'B', I can't tell you the answer!)</p>
<p>This is the same tool as describe in Module 2's <a href="/jump_to_id/75075fc132f440609538648c7c48ddaa" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Library Content</a> unit. In this case it is used to create a randomized assessment. </p>
