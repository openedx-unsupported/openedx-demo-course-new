<p>The <strong>Open Response Assessment </strong>(commonly known as <strong>ORA</strong>) assignment type allows you to ask learners to submit text, images and more for grading according to a rubric. There are many different ways to set up ORA assessments, including any combination of:</p>
<ul>
<li>Self-Assessment - Student assesses their own submission based on a rubric. </li>
<li>Peer-Assessment - Submission is distributed to peers in the course for assessment based on a rubric. The learner’s final score on a response is the sum of the median scores from all peer assessors for all of the required criteria. More information on how scores are calculated can be found in the <a href="https://edx.readthedocs.io/projects/open-edx-building-and-running-a-course/en/latest/exercises_tools/open_response_assessments/OpenResponseAssessments.html#how-scores-for-open-response-assessments-are-calculated" target="_blank" rel="noopener">documentation</a>. </li>
<li>Staff-Assessment - Staff assess the submission of a student based on a rubric. </li>
</ul>
<p>These modes allow you to assess the same submission in different ways before returning a grade back to your learners. ORAs are one of the most powerful assignment types on the Open edX platform and they can be used for a large number of different use-cases.</p>
