<p>We introduced the <strong class="blue-text">Peer Assessment</strong> feature of the Open Response Assessment tool in the <a href="/jump_to_id/f0aa93365d264e2fb14dc9c1b5efa976" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Intermediate Assessment Tools</a> section earlier. However, its significance warrants another discussion.</p>
<p>While you might have used its Self-Assessment mode, it also functions as a peer assessment tool. Here, students submit responses to a prompt and their peers provide feedback and grades based on a staff-defined rubric. This process teaches students to give proper feedback, as well as being able to measure their own work against their peers.</p>
