<div class="course-structure">
<p>Teams allow your learners to join student-formed or staff-assigned small groups for interaction and collaboration on activities.</p>

<p>There three variations to the way learners join teams:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Open</strong> sets up a team group where learner can create, join, leave, and see all teams within the group.</li>
<li><strong>Public managed</strong> allows only course staff to control team creation and membership. Learners can see other teams but cannot join or leave their team.</li>
<li><strong>Private managed</strong> allows only course staff to control team creation and membership. Additionally, learners can only see the teams they are members of, unlike other options that give them visibility into other teams. This type is helpful in particular if team assignments are being used in a course.</li>
</ul>
<p>Staff can monitor and moderate the small discussion area that is provided to each team, as well as promoting team members to Group Discussion TAs who gain limited moderation rights over their fellow teammates. This allows your learners to take control of group discussions for themselves, under a team leader.</p>
