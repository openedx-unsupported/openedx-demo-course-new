<h3>Course Outline</h3>
<p>The course outline (which you'll find if you click the "Course" link in the top left) shows an overview of the entire course and your progress throughout it. You'll notice that there are green checkmarks shown throughout the course (if they're not, please ask your site administrator to enable learner progress tracking!). These allow the learner to see the content they have completed throughout the course. A green check means that all components in a given unit are marked as complete, and if all units are marked as complete, the subsection will be marked as complete, and so on. Completion means something different for each component, but generally:</p>
<ul>
<li>If a component is interactive or graded, you'll need to submit a response for it to be considered completed</li>
<li>If the content is simply HTML, it just has to have loaded for a few seconds</li>
<li>If the content is a video, you'll need to watch at least 95% of the video for it to be considered complete</li>
</ul>
<p>Completion measures can be tweaked from the backend, so if you want to change them for all learners, speak with your site administrator!</p>
