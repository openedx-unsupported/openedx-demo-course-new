<div class="course-structure">
<p>This flexibility means that you can provide different course experiences for your learners in different cohorts without having to start an entirely separate course run.  Some examples of how this can be useful include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Providing different viewpoints on issues or questions to learners through different video case studies, then inviting them to discuss or debate their perspectives</li>
<li>Delivering context-specific content to learners based on their specializations, such as different programming languages or job roles</li>
<li>Performing research on the efficacy of different learning materials in a live course setting</li>
<li> Conducting different assessments based on different subsets of users, such as learners who have paid for access to additional content</li>
</ul>
<p>Content groups can be assigned at both the component and the unit level, so the difference can be as small as a single component, or an entire page of content, giving you the flexibility to hand-craft your experience for different cohorts.</p>
