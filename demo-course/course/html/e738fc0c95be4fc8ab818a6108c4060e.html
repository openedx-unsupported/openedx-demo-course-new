<h3>Instructor Dashboard</h3>
<p>Last but not least, the Instructor Dashboard is the part of the LMS where you, as an instructor, can manage your learners and includes things like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Course enrolment metrics</li>
<li>Data downloads</li>
<li>A gradebook showing the grades of all learners in the course</li>
<li>Tools to manage due date extensions, invite learners to your course, group your learners into cohorts, and adjust grades</li>
</ul>
<p>You'll only see the instructor dashboard if you're a staff member on this course. If you are, you'll see it on the menu at the top of the page.</p>
