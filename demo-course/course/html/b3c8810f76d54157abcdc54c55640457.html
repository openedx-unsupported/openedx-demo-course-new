<p>In the example above, you can see a common use case for Content Libraries: delivering randomized problems in a quiz or exam. The questions are stored in the content library and then pulled into the course by the randomized content block. If we modify any of those problems, that course then starts using its own version of the problem, so any modifications made to that problem are unique to the course. If we wanted to change this problem across all courses using that problem, we would instead update the content library and pull the updated version down into those courses instead.</p>
<p>The randomized content block will deliver a randomized subset and order of those problems to each individual learner and even only deliver a subset of those problems (such as only 3 of the 4 available problems), but where the modified problem appears, it will always be that courses' version of the problem, not the core content library's original. This same tool can be used for non-problem content too, allowing for a randomized content experience!</p>
