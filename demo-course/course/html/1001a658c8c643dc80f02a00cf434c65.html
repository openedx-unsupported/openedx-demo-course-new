<p><strong class="blue-text">SCORM</strong>, or <strong class="blue-text">Sharable Content Object Reference Model, </strong>is another educational standard for sharing learning objects. SCORM is an output format used by many popular authoring tools such as Articulate 360 and Adobe Captivate, allowing you to inject powerful custom content into your Open edX courses using the SCORM XBlock.</p>
<p>We strongly recommend using SCORM support to embed individual learning activities where possible rather than full courses, as this allows you to use interactive SCORM tools to augment your learning experiences, rather than replacing them! This provides your learners with the best of both worlds.</p>
