<p>An open source community relies on contributions from the community. You can contribute in a number of ways from adding to the platform's code to helping with documentation to providing ideas and suggestions for new features. </p>
<p>If you're a developer, or have access to a development team who will be making improvements to the ever-growing Open edX platform, you can help the platform evolve by contributing your bug fixes, features, XBlocks, and improvements back into the open source community. To learn more, check out the <a href="https://contributing-to-open-edx.readthedocs.io/en/latest/" alt="Contributing to Open edX docs guide" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Contributing to Open edX documentation.</a></p>
<p>If you're not a developer, we still want you to contribute to the community! You could <a href="https://docs.openedx.org/en/latest/documentors/quickstarts/first_documentation_pr.html" alt-="" guide="" to="" submitting="" your="" first="" open="" edx="" pr="" target="_blank" rel="noopener">contribute to the platform documentation</a> or keep an eye on the Slack channels and discussion forums for opportunities to share your feedback on various features, do some user testing, or provide suggestions for new features. </p>
<p>Contributors who remain active and regular over a longer period of time can be recognized as core contributors to the Open edX® community.</p>
