<p>As discussed on the previous page, cohorts aren't just used for dividing discussions, they can also be used for serving up a different learning experience to different learners!</p>
<p>These are known as <strong class="blue-text">Content Groups</strong>, which can be used for content experiments, A/B testing and serving different learning experiences for different learner personas within the same course. The content below is a basic example of this. As staff you'll see two components - one intended for Cohort A, and one intended for Cohort B. At the top of the page, you'll see the View As... bar, which will allow you to switch your view to each of those groups.</p>
