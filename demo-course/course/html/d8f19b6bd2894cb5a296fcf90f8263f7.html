<h4>Cohorts, Content Groups, and Components</h4>
<p>Cohorts can map to one content group. Course Components can map to one or more content groups. In this way, a course developer has flexibility in how cohort visibility can be configured. In the following image:Â </p>
<ul>
<li>Cohort A can view both components</li>
<li>Cohort B can only view component Y</li>
<li>Cohort C cannot view either component</li>
</ul>
