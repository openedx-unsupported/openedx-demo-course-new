<p>The <b>Staff-Graded Points </b>does not require a student submission. It exists to allow a staff to grant points directly to learners! This is useful in instructor-led courses where learners are expected to complete an activity outside of the platform, conduct an activity that can't be graded or to award your learners points for other participation such as contributions to your discussion forum community.</p>
