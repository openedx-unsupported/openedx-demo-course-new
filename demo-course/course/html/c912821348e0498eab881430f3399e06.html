<div class="course-structure">
<p><strong class="blue-text">Content libraries</strong> allow you to create a "bank" of content and re-use it across several courses. </p>
<p>Some examples of how content libraries are used include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Standardized learner satisfaction surveys</li>
<li>Question banks for randomized learner exams</li>
<li>Decorative components for course branding</li>
<li>Reusable interactive components</li>
</ul>
<p>Content libraries can be centrally managed or course specific:</p>
<p><strong>Centrally managed (default): </strong>Changes made at the library level can be synched to the course(s) where that library is in use. That way, courses can easily stay up to date with minimal duplicate maintenance.</p>
<p><strong>Course Specific:</strong>  Changes made at the course level will override the library. Those changes will not be synched back to the library, and new changes in the library won't overwrite your course-specific changes. Components become course-specific automatically if you modify them from within a specific course. </p>
