<h2>Note: </h2>
<p>This ORA is configured as a self-graded ORA. That means that you will be able to grade your own submission and the grade is immediately saved to the Open edX® LMS. If it included peer-grading or staff-grading steps, then it would be submitted into those queues and the grade would only be received after those processes are completed successfully. </p>
