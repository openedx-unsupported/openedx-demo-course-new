<p>The <strong class="blue-text">Survey </strong>component functions similarly to a Poll except it allows you to ask many questions at once with a standard set of answers. This is great for gathering general opinion data on things like the performance of your course or to ask whether learners agree with a range of statements following a video or reading.</p>

<h4>Best Practices</h4>

<li>Ensure every question you ask in a single survey has the same set of possible answers</li>
<li>Keep your answer options short and concise</li>
</ul>
