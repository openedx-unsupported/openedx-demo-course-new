<h3>Try it!</h3>
<p>A content library needs to be created outside of a course and so it cannot be packaged along with this demonstration course. Therefore, a video demonstration is included below that shows the creation of a 6 question bank and a quiz created with a random selection of three of the six questions. Each learner will have a unique "drawing" of the three questions and their order. </p>
<p>If you have staff privileges on this course and you <em>do </em>want to add a randomized content library to this course, we've included the steps to help you do so at the bottom of this page. </p>
