<h3>Components</h3>
<p>Components (also known as <a href="07c8d8e217e04f8ca2f10bbd3cb36980" target="_blank" rel="noopener">XBlocks</a>) are specific learning objects and include, but are not limited to:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Videos</strong></li>
<li><strong>HTML</strong> (text, images, iframed content)</li>
<li><strong>Basic CAPA Problems</strong> (such as multiple choice or text entry)</li>
<li><strong>Advanced Problems</strong> (such as drag-and-drop problems or Javascript assessments)</li>
<li><strong>Peer- and staff-assessed assignments</strong> (referred to as Open Response Assignments, or ORA)</li>
<li><strong>Third-party XBlocks</strong> (plugin components, such as Polls, Surveys, or integrations with third-party software)</li>
</ul>
<p>You can think of components as the building blocks of your course pages (your units), allowing you to put together your learning activities in whatever way you want learners to experience them!</p>
