<p><strong class="blue-text">LTI</strong>, or <strong class="blue-text">Learning Tools Interoperability, </strong>allows you to establish a secure connection between your LMS and another tool, allowing your learners to securely transfer the data necessary to complete an activity in an external learning tool without having to register. This also allows you to pass grades and other data between the two tools, making it invaluable for technical integrations. LTI is a standard across the learning industry and requires that the tool being used provides support for this type of connection, but this provides access to a huge number of potential learning tools available for your courses.</p>
<p>As of December 2023, the Open edX platform supports LTI 1.1 and LTI 1.3.</p>
