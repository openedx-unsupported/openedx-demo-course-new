<p>The assessment below uses a service called Codeboard and is connected via LTI. Because it is an LTI-connected tool, the student can use this external code-grading service from within the LMS without having to log in separately or share any personal information. When the work is submitted, the external service can submit a grade back to the LMS.Â </p>
