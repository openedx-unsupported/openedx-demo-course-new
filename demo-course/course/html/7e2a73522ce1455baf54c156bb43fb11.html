<p>Discussion moderators can receive email notifications for posts flagged as breaking your community guidelines, as well as move, edit, delete, pin, and lock posts, among other useful moderation tools in your discussion forum. Their posts are flagged as being from special course team members whenever they post and they even have the power to endorse valuable learner comments to highlight them to the rest of the discussion.</p>
