<p><strong class="blue-text">Discussions</strong> give learners the opportunity interact and engage with one each other and help to grow your course community by introducing social elements to their learning. Discussion forums are included by default in every course, though they can be closed during certain times by configuring "<a href="https://edx.readthedocs.io/projects/open-edx-building-and-running-a-course/en/latest/manage_discussions/running_discussions.html#specify-when-discussions-are-closed" target="_blank" rel="noopener">blackout dates</a>".</p>
<h4>Best Practices</h4>
<ul>
<li>Be available to students in the discussion prompt. Don't just let them ask questions in an empty void.Â </li>
<li>Use encouraging language, upvoting, and pinning to promote good discussion.</li>
<li>Add a text "prompt" before each discussion component to introduce the topic that you want learners to discuss. The discussion component itself does not contain any text and can be easy for learners to overlook, and you should always tell your learners exactly what they are expected to do.</li>
</ul>
