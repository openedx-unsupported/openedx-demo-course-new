<p>Open source software is software that is freely shared under an open source license, just like the Open edXÂ® platform.</p>
<p>Open source software, at its core, is a collaborative approach to software development, where the source code of a program is made available to the public. This allows a wide community of contributors to improve the software and review contributions given by other members of the community. The primary benefit to this is that it fosters innovation, ownership, and creativity in the community by allowing a diverse group of developers of different backgrounds and skills to collectively enhance the platform's functionality and security.</p>
