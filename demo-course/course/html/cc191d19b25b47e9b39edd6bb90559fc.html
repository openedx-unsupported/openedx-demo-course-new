<p>The <strong>'Done' </strong>XBlock, also known as the Completion Tool, allows you to provide learners with a simple button to mark a page or activity as having been completed. This effectively gives them a point for manually marking that they've done what has been asked of them, which makes it useful for tracking the completion of activities for staff grading and for assignments that require them to perform actions outside of your learning platform.</p>
