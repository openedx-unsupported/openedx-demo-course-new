<h3>Try it!</h3>
<p>We've included two sample JavaScript problems below for you to try.</p>
<p>The first is a demonstration of a very simple Javascript application that is hosted elsewhere that can send a grade and feedback back to the platform. It can be used as a template for building your own Javascript exercises. </p>
<p>The second assessment is a "choose-your-own-adventure" style simulation in which you play the role of a doctor diagnosing a patient. This is built in a free tool called <a href="https://twinery.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Twinery</a> as an example of the kinds of interactive exercises that can be built using just HTML, CSS, and Javascript. It demonstrates partial credit and adaptive feedback based on how a learner progresses through the exercise. </p>
