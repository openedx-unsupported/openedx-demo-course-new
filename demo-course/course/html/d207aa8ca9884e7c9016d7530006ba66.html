<p>The advanced video features enabled here are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>This short excerpt is pulled out of the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AOUEsgFrYeg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">49 minute-long original video</a> from the 2023 Open edX conference. Rather than embedding all 49 minutes, we chose the section we wanted to share, without having to download and edit the video.</li>
<li>The SRT closed captions and interactive transcript can be viewed in Spanish, as well as English.</li>
<li>By clicking download transcript, you will be taken to a PDF version of the transcript, formatted and prepared for offline use.</li>
<li>By clicking download handout, you will download the slide from the presentation itself. This could be anything, from the full PowerPoint slide deck, to an activity sheet to download. In this case, we've used a simple image.</li>
