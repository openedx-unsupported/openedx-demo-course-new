<p><strong class="blue-text">Annotation problems</strong> allow you to ask questions based on an annotated passage of text. This is great for subjects with a large amount of text analysis, such as law, literature or even programming, as you can ask questions about specific passages while providing their context so that your learners are sure about exactly which portion of the text or code you are asking about.</p>
