<h2>Note: Configuration Required</h2>
<p>There are two pieces of configuration that may be required to view the SCORM demonstration. If you choose not to do either, then you may also review the video to see the functionality. </p>
<h5>SCORM XBlock</h5>
<p>The SCORM X-block may not be installed by default on your instance of the Open edX® platform. If it is not installed, then the "Try it!" examples below will not work correctly. If you would like to install the SCORM XBlock, follow the <a href="https://github.com/overhangio/openedx-scorm-xblock#installation" target="_blank" rel="noopener">documentation</a>.</p>
<h5>SCORM Demonstration Package</h5>
<p>SCORM packages do not migrate with courses, so you will have to upload the SCORM package in studio. The package can be downloaded <a href="https://articulate-heroes.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/attachment/attachment_url/55098/SL360_LMS_SCORM_2004.zip" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>. Review the video to see how to upload the package into the SCORM XBlock. </p>
