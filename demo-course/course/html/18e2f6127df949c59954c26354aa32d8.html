<p>To access the Raw HTML editor, you can either select the Raw HTML template when inserting your HTML component:</p>
<p><img src="/static/raw_html_orig.png" alt="A list of templates for HTML components, with 'Raw HTML' highlighted." /></p>
<p>Or select HTML from within the editor itself:</p>
<p><img src="/static/html_button_orig.png" alt="The editing view of an HTML component. The button 'HTML' is highlighted on the far right end of the toolbar" /></p>
<p>Either way, you'll end up with the HTML editor, which looks something like this for this component.</p>
<p><img src="/static/code_editor_orig.png" alt="A screenshot of a simple HTML editor. The HTML within lays out the text and images of the component that you are currently reading, including this alternative text." /></p>
<p>If you've got the skills, the flexibility of HTML will let you build it in Studio.</p>
