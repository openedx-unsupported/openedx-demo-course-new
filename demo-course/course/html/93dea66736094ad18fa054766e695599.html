<h3>Best Practices &amp; Generating SRT Files</h3>
<p>It's important to ensure all of your videos have subtitles (and by extension transcripts) so that they are accessible to all learners, especially those with hearing difficulties. Transcripts are useful for all learners as they can be used to navigate the video to rewatch important points, and they can even show up in course search results, allowing learners to find exactly where they covered a piece of content they're struggling with.</p>
<p>If you include an .SRT file with your video component then your video will automatically display an option to view the interactive transcript.</p>
<p>SRT files can be generated via several tools you can find on the web, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>YouTube offers a free <a href="https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2734796" target="_blank" rel="noopener">captioning tool</a></li>
<li>Various free, freemium, and paid services, of which there are many. Google "Transcriptions &amp; Subtitles tool" to find a selection.Â </li>
</ul>
