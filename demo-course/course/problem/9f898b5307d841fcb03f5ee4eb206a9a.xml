            <p>Explanation:</p>
            <p>
                Using the quadratic formula, the roots are found to be \(x = 2\) and \(x = 1\). Thus, the higher value, 2, is the correct answer here. The lower value, 1, would receive partial credit.

  <hint>Recall the quadratic equation: \(x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\)</hint>
  <hint>For the given equation \(x^2 - 3x + 2 = 0\), a = 1, b = -3, and c = 2.</hint>
    <hint>Using the quadratic formula, one root is \(x = 2\) and the other is \(x = 1\).</hint>
