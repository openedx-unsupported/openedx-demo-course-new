<h3>Setting up Cohorts</h3>
<p>Cohorts are defined in your Instructor Dashboard, in the Cohorts panel.</p>

<h2>Note:</h2>
<p>Cohort configurations do not migrate with courses, so cohorts will not be set up in this course unless you set them up.</p>
</div>
<p>There are two modes for cohorts - automatic and manual:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Automatic</strong> cohorts assign learners to the cohort the moment they join the course. If there are multiple automatic cohorts set up, learners will be divided between them.</li>
<li><strong>Manual</strong> cohorts wait for you to assign learners to them manually from the Cohorts panel, either through a list of email addresses or usernames.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you use this feature for your courses, we recommend setting up at least one automatic cohort to 'catch' all learners who aren't manually assigned to cohorts, even if you intend to use manual cohorts. That way you can easily review which learners might have fallen through the cracks by checking the membership of that automatic cohort!</p>
<p>Once cohorts are set up, you can configure your discussion settings to set which discussions should be divided by cohort, and which should be available to your entire course.</p>
