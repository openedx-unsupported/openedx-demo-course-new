<p><strong class="blue-text">Cohorts</strong> are course-level groups of learners that you can use for a variety of purposes, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Dividing discussion forums into smaller sub-sets of learners</li>
<li>Segmenting your learners into groups for reporting</li>
<li>Providing a different learning experience for different groups of learners</li>
</ul>
<p>For example, if you were offering a training course and you wanted manager-level employees to have additional or slightly different content than the rest of the learners, you might opt to use cohorts! Let's take a look at how they work.</p>
